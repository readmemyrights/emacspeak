<p>Emacspeak provides a small number of core services around which the
remainder of the audio interface is constructed.  These essential
features of the software are briefly outlined in the following
paragraphs; the commands by which they can be controlled will be
described later in the manual.
</p>
<p>Apart from providing a fluent spoken interface to all of Emacs&rsquo; basic
editing functions, Emacspeak also includes software modules which add
speech feedback to a range of applications that can be run from within
Emacs. In this sense, Emacspeak amounts to much more than a talking
text editor; indeed, it can more aptly be characterized as a true
&ldquo;audio desktop&rdquo;, in which speech is treated as a first-class output modality.
</p>
<p>Emacspeak implements a special minor mode, known as &ldquo;voice lock mode&rdquo;
(see <a href="Voice_002dlock.html">Voice Lock Mode</a>) which uses distinct speech characteristics to
provide aural highlighting of specific textual constructs, such as
comments in program code, quoted strings and reserved words See <a href="Voice-Lock.html">Voice Lock</a>. This facility is further extended when Emacspeak is used with the
<code>EWW</code> and <code>W3</code> Web browsers, to enable the semantic and
structural distinctions captured by the HTML markup to be communicated
efficiently See <a href="Web-Browsing.html">Web Browsing</a>.
</p>
<p>It is often desirable to exercise control over the pronunciation of a
word (E.G. a technical term or a reserved word in a programming
language) within specific contexts. Emacspeak maintains pronunciation
dictionaries for this purpose, which may be customized by the
user. Moreover, individual dictionaries can be activated selectively,
depending for example on the current major mode or the name of the
file which is being visited See <a href="emacspeak_002dpronounce.html">emacspeak-pronounce</a>.
</p>
<p>In addition to spoken feedback, Emacspeak can generate &ldquo;auditory
icons&rdquo;  &mdash; short sound cues which alert the user to significant
events, for example the opening or deletion of a file, the completion
of an action, the arrival of an electronic mail message or the
creation of a completion buffer. Sound cues act as a supplement to the
spoken interface, and are especially valuable to the experienced user
in facilitating rapid interaction. Note that in order to support
auditory icons, the computer must be equipped with sound hardware for
which the operating system has been correctly configured
