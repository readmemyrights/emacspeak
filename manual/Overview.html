    Overview</h3>
    <p>Emacspeak provides a small number of core services around
    which the remainder of the audio interface is constructed.
    These essential features of the software are briefly outlined
    in the following paragraphs; the commands by which they can be
    controlled will be described later in the manual.</p>
    <p>Apart from providing a fluent spoken interface to all of
    Emacs’ basic editing functions, Emacspeak also includes
    software modules which add speech feedback to a range of
    applications that can be run from within Emacs. In this sense,
    Emacspeak amounts to much more than a talking text editor;
    indeed, it can more aptly be characterized as a true “audio
    desktop”, in which speech is treated as a first-class output
    modality.</p>
    <p>Emacspeak implements a special minor mode, known as “voice
    lock mode” (see <a class="pxref" href=
    "Voice_002dlock.html">Voice Lock Mode</a>) which uses distinct
    speech characteristics to provide aural highlighting of
    specific textual constructs, such as comments in program code,
    quoted strings and reserved words See <a class="xref" href=
    "Voice-Lock.html">Voice Lock</a>. This facility is further
    extended when Emacspeak is used with the <code class=
    "code">EWW</code> and <code class="code">W3</code> Web
    browsers, to enable the semantic and structural distinctions
    captured by the HTML markup to be communicated efficiently See
    <a class="xref" href="Web-Browsing.html">Web Browsing</a>.</p>
    <p>It is often desirable to exercise control over the
    pronunciation of a word (E.G. a technical term or a reserved
    word in a programming language) within specific contexts.
    Emacspeak maintains pronunciation dictionaries for this
    purpose, which may be customized by the user. Moreover,
    individual dictionaries can be activated selectively, depending
    for example on the current major mode or the name of the file
    which is being visited See <a class="xref" href=
    "emacspeak_002dpronounce.html">emacspeak-pronounce</a>.</p>
    <p>In addition to spoken feedback, Emacspeak can generate
    “auditory icons” — short sound cues which alert the user to
    significant events, for example the opening or deletion of a
    file, the completion of an action, the arrival of an electronic
    mail message or the creation of a completion buffer. Sound cues
    act as a supplement to the spoken interface, and are especially
    valuable to the experienced user in facilitating rapid
    interaction. Note that in order to support auditory icons, the
    computer must be equipped with sound hardware for which the
    operating system has been correctly configured See <a class=
    "xref" href=
    "emacspeak_002dsounds.html">emacspeak-sounds</a>.</p>
