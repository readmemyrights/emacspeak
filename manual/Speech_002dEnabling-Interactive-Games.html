    <h4 class="subsection">16.9.1 Speech-Enabling Interactive
    Games</h4>
    <p>So in 1997, I went the next step in asking — given access to
    the underlying information, is it possible to build effective
    eyes-free interaction to highly interactive tasks? I picked
    <strong>Tetris</strong> as a means of exploring this space, the
    result was an Emacspeak extension to speech-enable module
    <strong>tetris.el</strong>. The details of what was learned
    were published as a paper in Assets 98, and expanded as a
    chapter on Conversational Gestures in my book on Auditory
    Interfaces; that book was in a sense a culmination of stepping
    back and gaining a sense of perspective of what I had build
    during this period. The work on Conversational Gestures also
    helped in formalizing the abstract user interface layer that
    formed part of the <a href=
    "http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/">XForms</a> work at the
    W3C.</p>
    <p>Speech-enabling games for effective eyes-free interaction
    has proven highly educational. Interactive games are typically
    built to challenge the user, and if the eyes-free interface is
    inefficient, you just won’t play the game — contrast this with
    a task that you <strong>must</strong> perform, where you’re
    likely to make do with a sub-optimal interface. Over the years,
    Emacspeak has come to include eyes-free interfaces to several
    games including <a href=
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris">Tetris</a>, <a href=
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)">Sudoku</a>,
    and of late the popular <a href=
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)">2048 game</a>.
    Each of these have in turn contributed to enhancing the
    interaction model in Emacspeak, and those innovations typically
    make their way to the rest of the environment.</p>
