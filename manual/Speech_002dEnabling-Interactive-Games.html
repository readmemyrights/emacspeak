    Speech-Enabling Interactive Games</h4>
    <p>So in 1997, I went the next step in asking — given access to
    the underlying information, is it possible to build effective
    eyes-free interaction to highly interactive tasks? I picked
    <strong class="strong">Tetris</strong> as a means of exploring
    this space, the result was an Emacspeak extension to
    speech-enable module <strong class="strong">tetris.el</strong>.
    The details of what was learned were published as a paper in
    Assets 98, and expanded as a chapter on Conversational Gestures
    in my book on Auditory Interfaces; that book was in a sense a
    culmination of stepping back and gaining a sense of perspective
    of what I had build during this period. The work on
    Conversational Gestures also helped in formalizing the abstract
    user interface layer that formed part of the <a class="url"
    href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/">XForms</a> work at the
    W3C.</p>
    <p>Speech-enabling games for effective eyes-free interaction
    has proven highly educational. Interactive games are typically
    built to challenge the user, and if the eyes-free interface is
    inefficient, you just won’t play the game — contrast this with
    a task that you <strong class="strong">must</strong> perform,
    where you’re likely to make do with a sub-optimal interface.
    Over the years, Emacspeak has come to include eyes-free
    interfaces to several games including <a class="url" href=
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris">Tetris</a>, <a class=
    "url" href=
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)">Sudoku</a>,
    and of late the popular <a class="url" href=
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)">2048 game</a>.
    Each of these have in turn contributed to enhancing the
    interaction model in Emacspeak, and those innovations typically
    make their way to the rest of the environment.</p>
