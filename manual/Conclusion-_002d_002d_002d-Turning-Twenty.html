    — Turning Twenty</h3>
    <p>In 1996, I wrote an article entitled <a class="url" href=
    "http://www.drdobbs.com/user-interface-a-means-to-an-end/184410453">
    User Interface — A Means To An End</a> pointing out that the
    size and shape of computers were determined by the keyboard and
    display. This is even more true in today’s world of tablets,
    phablets and large-sized phones — with the only difference that
    the keyboard has been replaced by a touch screen. The next
    generation in the evolution of <strong class=
    "strong">personal</strong> devices is that they will become
    truly personal by being wearables — this once again forces a
    separation of the user interface peripherals from the
    underlying compute engine. Imagine a variety of wearables that
    collectively connect to ones cell phone, which itself connects
    to the cloud for all its computational and information needs.
    Such an environment is rich in possibilities for creating a
    wide variety of user experiences to a single underlying body of
    information; Eyes-Free interfaces as pioneered by systems like
    Emacspeak will come to play an increasingly vital role
    alongside visual interaction when this comes to pass.</p>
