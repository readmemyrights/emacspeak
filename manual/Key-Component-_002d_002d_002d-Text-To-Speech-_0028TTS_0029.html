    <p>Emacspeak is a speech-subsystem for Emacs; it depends on an
    external Text-To-Speech (TTS) engine to produce speech. In
    1994, Digital Equipment released what would turn out to be the
    last in the line of hardware DECTalk synthesizers, the DECTalk
    Express. This was essentially an Intel 386with 1mb of flash
    memory that ran a version of the DECTalk TTS software — to
    date, it still remains my favorite Text-To-Speech engine. At
    the time, I also had a software version of the same engine
    running on my DEC-Alpha workstation; the desire to use either a
    software or hardware solution to produce speech output defined
    the Emacspeak speech-server architecture.</p>
    <p>I went to IBM Research in 1999; this coincided with IBM
    releasing a version of the Eloquennce TTS engine on Linux under
    the name <em class="emph">ViaVoice Outloud</em>. My colleague
    Jeffrey Sorenson implemented an early version of the Emacspeak
    speech-server for this engine using the OSS API; I later
    updated it to use the ALSA library while on a flight back to
    SFO from Boston in 2001. That is still the TTS engine that is
    speaking as I type this article on my laptop.</p>
    <p>20 years on, TTS continues to be the weakest link on Linux;
    the best available solution in terms of quality continues to be
    the Linux port of Eloquence TTS available from Voxin in Europe
    for a small price. Looking back across 20 years, the state of
    TTS on Linux in particular and across all platforms in general
    continues to be a disappointment; most of today’s newer TTS
    engines are geared toward mainstream use-cases where <em class=
    "emph">naturalness</em> of the voice tends to supersede
    intelligibility at higher speech-rates. Ironically, modern TTS
    engines also give applications far less control over the
    generated output — as a case in point, I implemented <a class=
    "url" href=
    "http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/aster/demo.html">Audio
    System For Technical Readings (AsTeR)</a> in 1994 using the
    DECTalk; 20 years later, we implemented <a class="url" href=
    "http://allthingsd.com/20130604/t-v-ramans-audio-deja-vu-from-google-a-math-reading-system-for-the-web/">
    MathML support</a> in <a class="url" href=
    "http://www.chromevox.com/">ChromeVox</a> using Google TTS. In
    2013, it turned out to be difficult or impossible to implement
    the type of audio renderings that were possible with the
    admittedly less-natural sounding DECTalk!</p>
