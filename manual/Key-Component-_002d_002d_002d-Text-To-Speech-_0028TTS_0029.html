<p>Emacspeak is a speech-subsystem for Emacs; it depends on an
external Text-To-Speech (TTS) engine to produce speech. In 1994,
Digital Equipment released what would turn out to be the last in
the line of hardware DECTalk synthesizers, the DECTalk
Express. This was essentially an Intel 386with 1mb of flash
memory that ran a version of the DECTalk TTS software  &mdash;  to date,
it still remains my favorite Text-To-Speech engine. At the time,
I also had a software version of the same engine running on my
DEC-Alpha workstation; the desire to use either a software or
hardware solution to produce speech output defined the Emacspeak
speech-server architecture.
</p>
<p>I went to IBM Research in 1999; this coincided with IBM releasing
a version of the Eloquennce TTS engine on Linux under the name
<em>ViaVoice Outloud</em>. My colleague Jeffrey Sorenson implemented an
early version of the Emacspeak speech-server for this engine
using the OSS API; I later updated it to use the ALSA library
while on a flight back to SFO from Boston in 2001. That is still
the TTS engine that is speaking as I type this article on my
laptop.
</p>
<p>20 years on, TTS continues to be the weakest link on Linux; the
best available solution in terms of quality continues to be the
Linux port of Eloquence TTS available from Voxin in Europe for a
small price. Looking back across 20 years, the state of TTS on
Linux in particular and across all platforms in general continues
to be a disappointment; most of today&rsquo;s newer TTS engines are
geared toward mainstream use-cases where <em>naturalness</em> of the
voice tends to supersede intelligibility at higher
speech-rates. Ironically, modern TTS engines also give
applications far less control over the generated output  &mdash;  as a
case in point, I implemented
<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/aster/demo.html">Audio System For Technical Readings (AsTeR)</a> in 1994 using the
DECTalk; 20 years later, we implemented <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130604/t-v-ramans-audio-deja-vu-from-google-a-math-reading-system-for-the-web/">MathML support</a> in
<a href="http://www.chromevox.com/">ChromeVox</a> using Google TTS. In 2013, it turned out to be
difficult or impossible to implement the type of audio renderings
that were possible with the admittedly less-natural sounding
DECTalk!
