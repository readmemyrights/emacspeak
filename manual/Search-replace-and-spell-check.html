    <p>Incremental search, a process by which the system prompts
    the user for a search string and moves the selection to the
    next available match while allowing the user to add more
    characters to the search string, is the search technique of
    choice among most Emacs users. As the system successively finds
    each match, it provides the user the option of continuing the
    search. Incremental search is a more complex instance of
    traditional search interaction because in addition to either
    stopping or continuing the search, the user can modify the
    current search in a number of ways including specifying a
    longer (or shorter) search string.</p>
    <p>All of the user commands available during incremental search
    are documented in the online Emacs info manual. These are
    speech-enabled by Emacspeak to provide spoken prompts as the
    dialog begins; auditory icons indicate a search hit or search
    miss as the search progresses. Along with auditory icons
    <em class="emph">search-hit</em> and <em class=
    "emph">search-miss</em> the user also hears the current line
    spoken, and in the case of a search hit, the matching text is
    <em class="emph">aurally</em> highlighted by using the standard
    audio formatting technique of changing voice characteristic.
    This feedback proves extremely effective when the search
    pattern appears several times on a single line; the user is
    unambiguously cued to the current match.</p>
    <p>Search and replace actions are an extension to the basic
    conversational gestures of a search dialog. In addition to
    specifying a search string, the user also specifies a
    replacement string. On the Emacspeak desktop, this
    functionality is provided by command <em class=
    "emph">query-replace</em>. The speech-enabled version of this
    interaction prompts the user for the search and replacement
    texts. The auditory feedback during the interactive search and
    replacement process parallels that described in the case of
    incremental search. Audio formatting to indicate the occurrence
    that is about to be replaced proves an effective means of
    avoiding erroneous modifications to the text being edited. As
    an example, consider using command <em class=
    "emph">query-replace</em> to locate and replace the second
    occurrence of <b class="b">foo</b> with <b class="b">bar</b> in
    the text</p>
    <p>‘<samp class="samp">Do not change this fool, but change this
    food.</samp>’</p>
    <p>When the search matches the first occurrence of <b class=
    "b">foo</b> in word <em class="emph">fool</em>, the aural
    highlighting helps the user in answering “no” in response to
    question “should this occurrence be replaced”. In addition to
    allowing the user to supply a simple “yes or no” answer for
    each match, command <em class="emph">query-replace</em> also
    allows the user to specify a number of other valid answers as
    described in the online Emacs documentation.</p>
    <ul class="mini-toc">
      <li>
        <a href="#Spell-Checking" accesskey="1">Spell Checking</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="unnumberedsubsubsec-level-extent" id=
    "Spell-Checking">

      id="index-Spell-Check"></a>
      <p>A more complex instance of conversational gesture “search
      and replace” is exhibited by standard spell checking
      dialogues. Spell checking differs from the search and replace
      dialog described above in that the search and replacement
      text is guessed by the system based on an available
      dictionary. Words that are not found in the dictionary are
      flagged as potential spelling errors, and the system offers
      an interactive search and replace dialog for each of these
      possible errors. During this dialog, the system successively
      selects each occurrence of the possibly erroneous word and
      offers a set of possible replacements. Unlike in the case of
      simple search and replace, more than one possible replacement
      string is offered, since a potential spelling error can be
      corrected by more than one word appearing in the
      dictionary.</p>
      <p>In the visual interface, such spell checking dialogues are
      realized by displaying the available choices in a pop-up
      window and allowing the user to pick a correction Once a
      correction is selected, the user is offered the choice of
      interactively replacing the erroneous word with the
      correction.</p>
      <p>The spell checking interface on the Emacspeak desktop is
      speech-enabled to provide fluent auditory feedback. The
      visual interface parallels that described above and is
      provided by package <code class="code">ispell</code> which is
      part of the standard Emacs distribution. Emacspeak provides a
      spoken prompt that is composed of the line containing the
      possibly erroneous word (which is aurally highlighted to set
      it apart from the rest of the text on that line) and the
      available corrections. Each correction is prefixed with a
      number that the user can use to select it. Once a correction
      is selected, the interaction continues with the query and
      replace interaction described earlier. The speech interface
      to the spell checker is as fluent as the visual interface.
      Notice that Emacspeak users do not need to concern themselves
      with the details of the visual display such as “the
      corrections are displayed in a window at the top of the
      screen”.</p>
      <p>In addition to the standard spell checker described above,
      newer versions of Emacs include an “on-the-fly” spell checker
      that flags erroneous words as they are typed. Emacspeak
      speech-enables package <code class="code">flyspell</code> so
      that such erroneous words are aurally highlighted.</p>
