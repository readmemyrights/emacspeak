    16.13 Social Web — EMail, Instant Messaging, Blogging And
    Tweeting Using Open Protocols</h3>
    <p>The ability to process large amounts of email and electronic
    news has always been a feature of Emacs. I started using
    package <strong class="strong">vm</strong> for email in 1990,
    along with <strong class="strong">gnus</strong> for Usenet
    access many years before developing Emacspeak. So these were
    the first major packages that Emacspeak speech-enabled. Being
    able to access the underlying data structures used to visually
    render email messages and Usenet articles enabled Emacspeak to
    produce rich, succinct auditory output — this vastly increased
    my ability to consume and organize large amounts of
    information. Toward the turn of the century, instant messaging
    arrived in the mainstream — package <strong class=
    "strong">tnt</strong> provided an Emacs implementation of a
    chat client that could communicate with users on the then
    popular AOL Instant Messenger platform. At the time, I worked
    at IBM Research, and inspired by package <strong class=
    "strong">tnt</strong>, I created an Emacs client called
    <strong class="strong">ChatterBox</strong> using the Lotus
    Sametime API — this enabled me to communicate with colleagues
    at work from the comfort of Emacs. Packages like <strong class=
    "strong">vm</strong>, <strong class="strong">gnus</strong>,
    <strong class="strong">tnt</strong> and <strong class=
    "strong">ChatterBox</strong> provide an interesting example of
    how availability of a clean underlying API to a specific
    service or content stream can encourage the creation of
    efficient (and different) user interfaces. The touchstone of
    such successful implementations is a simple test — can the user
    of a specific interface tell if the person whom he is
    communicating with is also using the same interface? In each of
    the examples enumerated above, a user at one end of the
    communication chain cannot tell, and in fact shouldn’t be able
    to tell what client the user at the other end is using.
    Contrast this with closed services that have an inherent
    <em class="emph">lock-in</em> model e.g., proprietary word
    processors that use undocumented serialization formats — for a
    fun read, see this write-up on <a class="url" href=
    "http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/publications/colored-paper.html">
    Universe Of Fancy Colored Paper</a>.</p>
    <p>Today, my personal choice for instant messaging is the open
    Jabber platform. I connect to Jabber via Emacs package
    <strong class="strong">emacs-jabber</strong> and with Emacspeak
    providing a light-weight wrapper for generating the eyes-free
    interface, I can communicate seamlessly with colleagues and
    friends around the world.</p>
    <p>As the Web evolved to encompass ever-increasing swathes of
    communication functionality that had already been available on
    the Internet, we saw the world move from Usenet groups to
    <strong class="strong">Blogs</strong> — I remember initially
    dismissing the blogging phenomenon as just a re-invention of
    Usenet in the early days. However, mainstream users flocked to
    Blogging, and I later realized that blogging as a publishing
    platform brought along interesting features that made
    communicating and publishing information <strong class=
    "strong">much</strong> easier. In 2005, I joined Google; during
    the winter holidays that year, I implemented a light-weight
    client for Blogger that became the start of Emacs package
    <strong class="strong">g-client</strong> — this package
    provides Emacs wrappers for Google services that provide a
    RESTful API.</p>
