    <p>Emacspeak provides a complete audio desktop by
    speech-enabling all of Emacs.</p>
    <p>In the past, screen reading programs have allowed visually
    impaired users to get feedback using synthesized speech. Such
    programs have been commercially available for a long time. Most
    of them originally ran on PC’s under <abbr class=
    "acronym">DOS</abbr>, and have moved over to the Windows
    environment. However, screen-readers for the UNIX environment
    have been conspicuous in their absence. Note that this is now
    changing with the availability of console-level Linux
    screenreaders such as <code class="command">speakup</code>.
    Such Linux screenreaders provide the same level of UNIX
    accessibility provided in the late 80’s by PC terminal
    emulators running a <abbr class="acronym">DOS</abbr>
    screenreader. This means that most visually impaired computer
    users face the additional handicap of being <abbr class=
    "acronym">DOS</abbr>-impaired — a far more serious
    problem:-)</p>
    <p>Emacspeak is an emacs subsystem that provides complete
    speech access. It is <em class="emph">not</em> a screen-reader
    — rather, it is a complete user environment with built-in
    speech feedback. Emacspeak has a significant advantage; since
    it runs inside Emacs, a structure-sensitive, fully customizable
    environment, Emacspeak has more context-specific information
    about what it is speaking than its screenreader counterparts.
    This is why Emacspeak is not a “screenreader”, it is a system
    that produces speech output.</p>
    <p>A Traditional screen-reader speaks the content of the
    screen, leaving it to the user to interpret the visual layout.
    Emacspeak, on the other hand, treats speech as a first-class
    output modality; it speaks the information in a manner that is
    easy to comprehend when listening.</p>
    <p>The basic concepts used by Emacspeak are simple; all
    interactive Emacs commands have been adapted to provide speech
    feedback. Hence, you use Emacs as normal; Emacspeak works
    behind the scene to give audio feedback in addition to updating
    the screen.</p>
    <p>Emacspeak consists of a core speech system that provides
    speech and audio services to the rest of the Emacspeak desktop;
    application-specific extensions provide context-specific spoken
    feedback using these services. Emacspeak currently comes with
    speech extensions for several popular Emacs subsystems and
    editing modes. I would like to thank their respective authors
    for their wonderful work which makes Emacs more than a text
    editor<a class="footnote" id="DOCF1" href=

    <p>I have now been using Emacspeak under Linux as the only
    source of speech feedback since 1994.</p>
