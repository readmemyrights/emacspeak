    Well-formatted Documents</h4><a class="index-entry-id" id=
    "index-Document-Creation"></a>
    <p>Before authoring a document, decide its primary audience. If
    the document contains relatively simple content, e.g., no
    mathematical equations etc. and is primarily targeted at the
    web, you are probably better off using HTML. You can create
    well-structured HTML documents with the help of package
    <code class="code">nxml-mode</code> for editing XML documents.
    Another option is to use <code class="code">org-mode</code> to
    create a Wiki-like text document that can be easily published
    to multiple output formats including HTML.</p>
    <p>Packages <code class="code">org-mode</code> and <code class=
    "code">nxml-mode</code> are speech-enabled by Emacspeak to
    provide auditory icons, structured navigation and outlines, as
    well as voice locking for audio formatted feedback as you
    work.</p>
    <p>If the document being authored is more complex, you are
    usually better off creating it in LaTeX. Note that LaTeX
    documents can be converted to HTML either via package
    <code class="code">tex4ht</code> — available on the WWW.</p>
    <p>The TeX family of typesetting languages is suitable for
    producing well-formatted documents in an eyes-free environment.
    Unlike WYSIWYG environments, the author of a TeX or LaTeX
    document works with the content of the document, leaving it to
    the formatting system (TeX) to format the document for good
    visual presentation.</p>
    <p>The <code class="code">AUCTeX</code> package is an Emacs
    extension that facilitates authoring and maintaining structured
    documents in TeX and LaTeX. Package <code class=
    "code">bibtex</code> facilitates maintenance and use of
    <code class="code">bibtex</code> bibliography databases. The
    Texinfo package allows creation of software documentation that
    is suitable for both printing as well as online viewing as
    hypertext. Emacspeak speech-enables packages <code class=
    "code">AUCTeX</code>, <code class="code">bibtex</code> and
    <code class="code">texinfo</code> to provide convenient spoken
    feedback as you create documents. For details on using these
    packages, see their accompanying online info documentation.</p>
    <p>As the document preparation system of choice, Emacspeak
    supports a fluent speech-enabled interface to editing and
    formatting LaTeX documents. This interface is provided by
    speech-enabling <em class="emph">AUCTeX</em> mode.</p><a class=
    "index-entry-id" id="index-AUCTeX"></a>
    <p>Mode <em class="emph">AUCTeX</em> provides efficient
    keyboard shortcuts for inserting and maintaining LaTeX markup
    as a document is being authored. All of these editing commands
    provide succinct auditory feedback when used with Emacspeak.
    The syntax coloring provided by this mode is extended to
    provide <em class="emph">voice locking</em> — consequently,
    Emacspeak uses different voices to speak the embedded markup to
    set it apart from the content.</p>
    <p>Mode <em class="emph">AUCTeX</em> can be used to create
    empty document templates and to insert document content at the
    appropriate places in the template. The mode also enables
    structured navigation of the document as it is being edited.
    Emacspeak speech-enables these template creation and structured
    navigation commands to produce auditory icons and succinct
    spoken feedback. For example, while editing, the user can
    quickly browse through the sections of the document and have
    each section title spoken. Document elements such as paragraphs
    and bulleted lists can be manipulated as logical units. These
    features are especially relevant in an eyes-free environment
    where the user needs to select logical parts of the document
    without having to point at portions of a visual display.</p>
