<span id="index-Document-Creation"></span>

<p>Before authoring a document, decide its primary audience.  If the
document contains relatively simple content, e.g., no mathematical
equations etc. and is primarily targeted at the web, you are probably
better off using HTML.  You can create well-structured HTML documents
with the help of package <code>nxml-mode</code> for editing XML
documents.  Another option is to use <code>org-mode</code> to create a
Wiki-like text document that can be easily published to multiple
output formats including HTML.
</p>
<p>Packages <code>org-mode</code> and <code>nxml-mode</code> are speech-enabled by
Emacspeak to provide auditory icons, structured navigation and
outlines, as well as voice locking for audio formatted feedback as you
work.
</p>
<p>If the document being authored is more complex, you are usually better
off creating it in LaTeX.  Note that LaTeX documents can be converted
to HTML either via package <code>tex4ht</code>  &mdash; available on the
WWW.
</p>
<p>The TeX family of typesetting languages is suitable for producing
well-formatted documents in an eyes-free environment.  Unlike WYSIWYG
environments, the author of a TeX or LaTeX document works with the
content of the document, leaving it to the formatting system (TeX) to
format the document for good visual presentation.
</p>
<p>The <code>AUCTeX</code> package is an Emacs extension that facilitates
authoring and maintaining structured documents in TeX and LaTeX.
Package <code>bibtex</code> facilitates maintenance and use of <code>bibtex</code>
bibliography databases.  The Texinfo package allows creation of
software documentation that is suitable for both printing as well as
online viewing as hypertext.  Emacspeak speech-enables packages
<code>AUCTeX</code>, <code>bibtex</code> and <code>texinfo</code> to provide convenient
spoken feedback as you create documents.  For details on using these
packages, see their accompanying online info documentation.
</p>
<p>As the document preparation system of choice, Emacspeak supports a
fluent speech-enabled interface to editing and formatting LaTeX
documents.  This interface is provided by speech-enabling
<em>AUCTeX</em> mode.
</p>
<span id="index-AUCTeX"></span>

<p>Mode <em>AUCTeX</em> provides efficient keyboard shortcuts for inserting
and maintaining LaTeX markup as a document is being authored.  All of
these editing commands provide succinct auditory feedback when used
with Emacspeak.  The syntax coloring provided by this mode is extended
to provide <em>voice locking</em>  &mdash; consequently, Emacspeak uses
different voices to speak the embedded markup to set it apart from the
content.
</p>
<p>Mode <em>AUCTeX</em> can be used to create empty document templates and
to insert document content at the appropriate places in the template.
The mode also enables structured navigation of the document as it is
being edited.  Emacspeak speech-enables these template creation and
structured navigation commands to produce auditory icons and succinct
spoken feedback.  For example, while editing, the user can quickly
browse through the sections of the document and have each section
title spoken.  Document elements such as paragraphs and bulleted lists
can be manipulated as logical units.  These features are especially
relevant in an eyes-free environment where the user needs to select
logical parts of the document without having to point at portions of a
visual display.
