    <p>Emacs provides an extensive online help system for helping
    you learn about various aspects of using Emacs. Emacspeak
    provides online help for its various extensions using this same
    help system. This chapter explains how to use the online help
    facilities in order to empower you in discovering powerful and
    versatile working techniques that will make you more and more
    productive in your day to day computing.</p>
    <p>The online help options are accessed via the <kbd class=
    "kbd">C-h</kbd> prefix key, which must be followed by an
    additional letter or control character to designate the kind of
    help desired. For example, <kbd class="kbd">C-h t</kbd>
    <code class="code">help-with-tutorial</code> visits the Emacs
    tutorial in a new buffer; <kbd class="kbd">C-h i</kbd>
    <code class="code">info</code> enters the Info documentation
    system, from which you can read Texinfo manuals that have been
    installed on your system, including the Emacs and Emacspeak
    documentation; and <kbd class="kbd">C-h k</kbd> <code class=
    "code">describe-key</code> provides a description of the Emacs
    function which is bound to the next key that you type. For
    learning about the various options that are available via the
    <kbd class="kbd">C-h</kbd> mechanism described above, view the
    online help for command <code class="code">help-for-help</code>
    bound to <kbd class="kbd">C-h C-h</kbd> — using what has been
    described so far, you would achieve this by pressing
    <kbd class="kbd">C-h k</kbd> followed by <kbd class="kbd">C-h
    C-h</kbd>.</p>
    <p>Emacspeak users should note that online help is typically
    displayed in a separate Emacs window. Where it makes sense to
    do so, Emacspeak will automatically speak the displayed help.
    Once you’ve asked for help, you can hear the displayed
    documentation as many times as you wish using Emacspeak command
    <code class="code">emacspeak-speak-help</code> bound to
    <kbd class="kbd">C-e h</kbd>. If you want to move through the
    displayed help a line at a time, switch to the buffer where the
    help is displayed — the buffer is called <code class=
    "code">*Help*</code>.</p>
    <p>Often, in adding an auditory interface to an Emacs
    extension, such as a web browser or mail reader, Emacspeak
    defines additional commands and key bindings which enhance the
    functionality of the spoken feedback provided by the
    application. This manual does not purport to document all such
    commands. It is important, therefore, when learning to use the
    various Emacs extensions which comprise the ‘audio desktop’
    (see <a class="pxref" href="Audio-Desktop.html">The Emacspeak
    Audio Desktop.</a>) that you take advantage of online help to
    obtain details of any context-specific features provided by
    Emacspeak. The following two commands are of particular
    importance in this regard:</p>
    <ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
      <li><kbd class="kbd">C-h m</kbd> <code class=
      "code">describe-mode</code> explains which major and minor
      modes are currently in effect, and lists the commands and key
      bindings associated with them.</li>
      <li><kbd class="kbd">C-h b</kbd> <code class=
      "code">describe-bindings</code> lists all of the key bindings
      which are currently defined.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The importance of these help functions can be illustrated by
    the Emacs/W3 web browser. When point is positioned inside a
    table, certain key bindings are established with which you can
    access Emacspeak commands that make it possible to read the
    rows and columns of the table and explore its structure
    efficiently. To get a description of these key bindings, you
    can use W3 to visit the sample <abbr class="acronym" title=
    "Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> file supplied as part
    of the Emacspeak distribution, and, after having moved point
    onto the first row of the table, issue the command <kbd class=
    "kbd">C-h m</kbd> <code class="code">describe-mode</code> to
    create a help buffer containing an explanation of the features
    offered by W3 mode.</p>
    <p>Emacspeak supplements the online help facilities available
    within Emacs by defining several commands of its own, as
    follows:</p>
    <ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
      <li><kbd class="kbd">C-h c-e</kbd> <code class=
      "code">describe-emacspeak</code> presents a list of standard
      Emacspeak commands.</li>
      <li><kbd class="kbd">C-e F</kbd> <code class=
      "code">emacspeak-view-emacspeak-faq</code> opens a new buffer
      containing the Emacspeak <abbr class="acronym">FAQ</abbr>, a
      list of frequently asked questions about Emacspeak together
      with their answers.</li>
      <li><kbd class="kbd">C-e &lt;F1&gt;</kbd> <code class=
      "code">emacspeak-learn-mode</code> enters a mode in which the
      function of every key that you type is spoken; this mode can
      be terminated with the <kbd class="kbd">C-g</kbd>
      <code class="code">keyboard-quit</code> command.</li>
    </ul>
