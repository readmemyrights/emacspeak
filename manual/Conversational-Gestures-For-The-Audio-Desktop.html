    <p>By 1996, Emacspeak was the only piece of adaptive technology
    I used; in fall of 1995, I had moved to Adobe Systems from DEC
    Research to focus on enhancing the Portable Document Format
    (PDF) to make PDF content repurposable. Between 1996 and 1998,
    I was primarily focused on electronic document formats — I took
    this opportunity to step back and evaluate what I had built as
    an auditory interface within Emacspeak. This retrospect proved
    extremely useful in gaining a sense of perspective and led to
    formalizing the high-level concept of <em class=
    "emph">Conversational Gestures</em> and structured
    browsing/searching as a means of thinking about user
    interfaces.</p>
    <p>By now, Emacspeak was a complete environment — I formalized
    what it provided under the moniker <em class="emph">Complete
    Audio Desktop</em>. The fully integrated user experience
    allowed me to move forward with respect to defining interaction
    models that were highly optimized to eyes-free interaction — as
    an example, see how Emacspeak interfaces with modes like
    <strong class="strong">dired</strong> (Directory Editor) for
    browsing and manipulating the filesystem, or <strong class=
    "strong">proced</strong> (Process Editor) for browsing and
    manipulating running processes. Emacs’ integration with
    <strong class="strong">ispell</strong> for spell checking, as
    well as its various completion facilities ranging from
    minibuffer completion to other forms of dynamic completion
    while typing text provided more opportunities for creating
    innovative forms of eyes-free interaction. With respect to what
    had gone before (and is still par for the course as far as
    traditional screen-readers are concerned), these types of
    highly dynamic interfaces present a challenge. For example,
    consider handling a completion interface using a screen-reader
    that is speaking the visual display. There is a significant
    challenge in deciding <em class="emph">what to speak</em> e.g.,
    when presented with a list of completions, the currently typed
    text, and the default completion, which of these should you
    speak, and in what order? The problem gets harder when you
    consider that the underlying semantics of these items is
    generally not available from examining the visual presentation
    in a consistent manner. By having direct access to the
    underlying information being presented, Emacspeak had a leg up
    with respect to addressing the higher-level question — when you
    do have access to this information, how do you present it
    effectively in an eyes-free environment? For this and many
    other cases of dynamic interaction, a combination of audio
    formatting, auditory icons, and the ability to synthesize
    succinct messages from a combination of information items —
    rather than having to forcibly speak each item as it is
    rendered visually provided for highly efficient eyes-free
    interaction.</p>
    <p>This was also when I stepped back to build out Emacspeak’s
    table browsing facilities — see the online Emacspeak
    documentation for details on Emacspeak’s table browsing
    functionality which continues to remain one of the richest
    collection of end-user affordances for working with
    two-dimensional data.</p>
