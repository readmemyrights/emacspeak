    16.6 Emacspeak And Authoring Documents</h3>
    <p>In 1994, my preferred environment for authoring
    <strong class="strong">all</strong> documents was
    <strong class="strong">LaTeX</strong> using the Auctex package.
    Later I started writing either LaTeX or HTML using the
    appropriate support modes; today I use <strong class=
    "strong">org-mode</strong> to do most of my content authoring.
    Personally, I have never been a fan of What You See Is What You
    Get (WYSIWYG) authoring tools — in my experience that places an
    undue burden on the author by drawing attention away from the
    content to focus on the final appearance. An added benefit of
    creating content in Emacs in the form of light-weight markup is
    that the content is long-lived — I can still usefully process
    and re-use things I have written 25 years ago.</p>
    <p>Emacs, with Emacspeak providing audio formatting and
    context-specific feedback remains my environment of choice for
    writing all forms of content ranging from simple email messages
    to polished documents for print publishing. And it is worth
    repeating that I <strong class="strong">never</strong> need to
    focus on what the content is going to look like — that job is
    best left to the computer.</p>
    <p>As an example of producing high-fidelity visual content, see
    this write-up on <a class="url" href=
    "http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/raman/publications/polyhedra/">
    Polyhedral Geometry</a> that I published in 2002; all of the
    content, including the drawings were created by me using
    Emacs.</p>
