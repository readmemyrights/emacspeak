<p>Today, the Web, based on URLs and HTTP-style protocols is widely
recognized as a platform in its own right. This platform emerged
over time  &mdash;  to me, Web APIs arrived in the late 90&rsquo;s when I
observed the following with respect to my own behavior on many
popular sites:
</p>
<ol>
<li> I opened a Web page that took a while to load (remember,  I
was still using Emacs-W3),
</li><li> I then searched through the page to find a form-field that
I filled out, e.g., start and end destinations on Yahoo
Maps,
</li><li> I hit <strong>submit</strong>, and once again waited for a heavy-weight
HTML page to load,
</li><li> And finally, I hunted through the rendered content to find
what I was looking for.
</li></ol>

<p>This pattern repeated across a wide-range of interactive Web
sites ranging from AltaVista for search (this was pre-Google),
Yahoo Maps for directions, and Amazon for product searches to
name but a few. So I decided to automate away the pain by
creating Emacspeak module <strong>emacspeak-websearch</strong> that did the
following:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Prompt via the minibuffer for the requisite fields,
</li><li> Consed up an HTTP GET URL,
</li><li> Retrieved this URL,
</li><li> And filtered out the specific portion of the HTML  DOM that
held the generated response.
</li></ol>

<p>Notice that the above implementation hard-wires the CGI parameter
names used by a given Web application into the code implemented
in module <strong>emacspeak-websearch</strong>. REST as a design pattern had not
yet been recognized, leave alone formalized, and module
<strong>emacspeak-websearch</strong> was initially criticized as being fragile.
</p>
<p>However, over time, the CGI parameter names remained fixed  &mdash;  the
 only things that have required updating in the Emacspeak
 code-base are the content filtering rules that extract the
 response  &mdash;  for popular services, this has averaged about one to
 two times a year.
</p>

<p>I later codified these filtering rules in terms of XPath, and
also integrated XSLT-based pre-processing of incoming HTML
content before it got handed off to Emacs-W3  &mdash;  and yes,
Emacs/Advice once again came in handy with respect to injecting
XSLT pre-processing into Emacs-W3!
</p>
<p>Later, in early 2000, I created companion module
<strong>emacspeak-url-templates</strong>  &mdash;  partially inspired by Emacs&rsquo;
<strong>webjump</strong> module. URL templates in Emacspeak leveraged the
recognized REST interaction pattern to provide a large collection
of Web widgets that could be quickly invoked to provide rapid
access to the right pieces of information on the Web.
</p>
<p>The final icing on the cake was the arrival of RSS and Atom feeds
and the consequent deep-linking into content-rich sites  &mdash;  this
meant that Emacspeak could provide audio renderings of useful
content without having to deal with complex visual navigation!
While Google Reader existed, Emacspeak provided a light-weight
<strong>greader</strong> client for managing ones feed subscriptions; with the
demise of Google Reader, I implemented module <strong>emacspeak-feeds</strong>
for organizing feeds on the Emacspeak desktop. A companion
package <strong>emacspeak-webspace</strong> implements additional goodies
including a continuously updating ticker of headlines taken from
the user&rsquo;s collection of subscribed feeds.
