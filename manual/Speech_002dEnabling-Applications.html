    <p>The underlying thesis behind AsTeR (Audio System For
    Technical Readings) and later Emacspeak is that information is
    display-independent. This leads to the insight that producing
    auditory renderings of information starting from the true
    source of that information often produces better renderings
    than those that result from working from a modality-specific
    representation; thus, attempting to speak visually rendered
    information can often prove sub-optimal. AsTeR applied these
    ideas to documents authored in LaTeX; Emacspeak generalized
    these ideas to user interfaces.</p>
    <p>Emacspeak was therefore designed from the ground-up to
    enable applications generate their own spoken feedback, rather
    than having an external software program construct the spoken
    feedback by responding to events in its environment.</p>
    <p>In Emacspeak, theory meets practice to deliver a working
    implementation; Emacspeak leverages the power of Emacs and its
    embedded Lisp interpreter to inject spoken feedback into
    applications that run within Emacs. For a detailed overview on
    how the <em class="emph">advice</em> mechanism in Emacs is
    used, see the original Assets96 paper, as well as the chapter
    on Emacspeak in the OReilly publication entitled <a class="url"
