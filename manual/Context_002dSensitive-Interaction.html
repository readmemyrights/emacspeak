<span id="index-Context_002dSensitive-Interaction"></span>

<p>The content-specific user interaction described above is a very
powerful feature of Emacs, and this is where Emacspeak derives its
power.  Traditionally, the ability to create buffers specialized for
working with specific content-types has been used by the Emacs
community to develop versatile programming environments, messaging
applications such as mail and news readers, and authoring
environments.  The clean design present in all of these Emacs
extensions in terms of separating application functionality from the
user-interface, combined with the availability of the entire source
code making up these packages under the open-source model has laid the
ground-work for developing Emacspeak as a versatile aural counterpart
to the product of years of software engineering that has been invested
by the Emacs community.  In short, Emacspeak would not exist in its
present shape or form without this prior effort.

<div class="subsection" id="Audio-Formatted-Output">
<h4 class="subsection">7.3.1 Audio Formatted Output</h4>

<span id="index-Audio-Formatting"></span>

<p>Emacspeak takes advantage of the content-specific knowledge available
within specialized buffers to produce &ldquo;audio formatted&rdquo; output
designed to optimize user interaction.  A basic consequence of the
above is &ldquo;voice locking&rdquo; in specialized modes; a more interesting
consequence is the implementation of Aural Cascading Style Sheets
(<acronym>ACSS</acronym>) in conjunction with the Emacs <acronym title="Emacs Web
Wowser">EWW</acronym> (Emacs Web
Wowser) and <acronym>W3</acronym> Web browsers.
</p>
</div>
<div class="subsection" id="Structured-Navigation_003a">
<h4 class="subsection">7.3.2 Structured Navigation:</h4>

<span id="index-Structured-Navigation"></span>

<p>Emacspeak also exploits content-specific knowledge to provide
structured navigation of different types of electronic content.  In
many cases, such structured navigation is an extension of what Emacs
provides by default; in other cases, Emacspeak implements the
necessary extensions to provide the level of structural navigation
needed to work efficiently in an eyes-free environment.
</p>
<p>Notable among such structured navigation is Emacs&rsquo; powerful outline
feature.
</p>
<p>An example of content-sensitive navigation is provided by the <code>imenu</code>
package which dynamically creates a &ldquo;table of contents&rdquo; based on the
content that is being displayed in a given buffer.  Emacs
<em>Selective Display</em> lets one easily hide and expose portions of a
buffer based on indentation  &mdash; this feature can be used to
advantage when working with program source code.
</p>

</div>
<div class="subsection" id="Navigating-The-Desktop">
<h4 class="subsection">7.3.3 Navigating The Desktop</h4>

<span id="index-Desktop-Navigation"></span>

<p>In addition to navigating individual information objects, the
Emacspeak environment provides speech-enabled navigation of the
various buffers that are currently open on the Emacspeak desktop via
Emacs&rsquo; built-in list-buffers feature.  Emacs&rsquo; dired  &mdash; directory
editor  &mdash; for browsing the file system, along with the new
speedbar package that combines features from dired and imenu round off
the suite of navigational tools.
</p>
</div>
<div class="subsection" id="Everything-Is-Searchable_003a">
<h4 class="subsection">7.3.4 Everything Is Searchable:</h4>

<span id="index-Searching"></span>
<span id="index-Finding"></span>

<p>Emacs derives one final advantage from using buffers as the basic
building block for the entire desktop.  Every Emacs buffer is
searchable via a uniform and powerful search interface.  Emacs&rsquo;
incremental search works efficiently and consistently to enable you
locate &ldquo;objects&rdquo; of interest either within a given document or to
locate a given object from among the various objects that are
currently open on the Emacspeak desktop.  This is <b>very powerful</b>
 &mdash; where a <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym> (Graphical User Interface) user is
typically limited to quickly locating an object from a relatively
small collection  &mdash; the size of the collection being a direct
function of available display real-estate  &mdash; the Emacspeak user
can typically work with a far larger collection of objects.  This is
well-suited to the eyes-free environment, where display real-estate
has no meaning; so bringing up a list of currently open buffers and
performing an incremental search to locate a specific buffer is just
as efficient independent of whether you have a few dozen or a few
hundred buffers open.
</p>
<p>To illustrate the above, my typical working Emacs session lasts
between two and three weeks  &mdash; over that time I typically
accumulate several hundred open buffers holding a large variety of
content ranging from program source code to email messages and
<acronym>WWW</acronym> pages.
</p>
<p>Ubiquitous search in the eyes-free environment is critical  &mdash; as
a comparison, when using a conventional, purely visual WWW browser,
users have no means of easily &ldquo;searching&rdquo; for say the &ldquo;submit&rdquo;
button on a WWW page.  This inability is a minor annoyance in visual
interaction, and the typical mouse-enabled user <b>never</b> uses the
find dialog to find a submit button  &mdash; it is simply more
efficient to point at the submit button given the eye&rsquo;s ability to
quickly scan the two-dimensional display.  This luxury is absent in an
eyes-free environment; as a consequence, blind users confronted by the
combination of a visual interface and screen-reader are typically
limited to either tabbing through all the controls on a <acronym>WWW</acronym>
page, or using the sub-optimal find dialog.
