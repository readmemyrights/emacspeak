    <p>The content-specific user interaction described above is a
    very powerful feature of Emacs, and this is where Emacspeak
    derives its power. Traditionally, the ability to create buffers
    specialized for working with specific content-types has been
    used by the Emacs community to develop versatile programming
    environments, messaging applications such as mail and news
    readers, and authoring environments. The clean design present
    in all of these Emacs extensions in terms of separating
    application functionality from the user-interface, combined
    with the availability of the entire source code making up these
    packages under the open-source model has laid the ground-work
    for developing Emacspeak as a versatile aural counterpart to
    the product of years of software engineering that has been
    invested by the Emacs community. In short, Emacspeak would not
    exist in its present shape or form without this prior
    effort.</p>

      <p>Emacspeak takes advantage of the content-specific
      knowledge available within specialized buffers to produce
      “audio formatted” output designed to optimize user
      interaction. A basic consequence of the above is “voice
      locking” in specialized modes; a more interesting consequence
      is the implementation of Aural Cascading Style Sheets
      (<abbr class="acronym">ACSS</abbr>) in conjunction with the
      Emacs <abbr class="acronym" title=
      "Emacs Web Wowser">EWW</abbr> (Emacs Web Wowser) and
      <abbr class="acronym">W3</abbr> Web browsers.</p>

      "#Structured-Navigation_003a">¶</a></span></h4><a class=
      "index-entry-id" id="index-Structured-Navigation"></a>
      <p>Emacspeak also exploits content-specific knowledge to
      provide structured navigation of different types of
      electronic content. In many cases, such structured navigation
      is an extension of what Emacs provides by default; in other
      cases, Emacspeak implements the necessary extensions to
      provide the level of structural navigation needed to work
      efficiently in an eyes-free environment.</p>
      <p>Notable among such structured navigation is Emacs’
      powerful outline feature.</p>
      <p>An example of content-sensitive navigation is provided by
      the <code class="code">imenu</code> package which dynamically
      creates a “table of contents” based on the content that is
      being displayed in a given buffer. Emacs <em class=
      "dfn">Selective Display</em> lets one easily hide and expose
      portions of a buffer based on indentation — this feature can
      be used to advantage when working with program source
      code.</p>

    <div class="subsection-level-extent" id=

      "#Navigating-The-Desktop">¶</a></span></h4><a class=
      "index-entry-id" id="index-Desktop-Navigation"></a>
      <p>In addition to navigating individual information objects,
      the Emacspeak environment provides speech-enabled navigation
      of the various buffers that are currently open on the
      Emacspeak desktop via Emacs’ built-in list-buffers feature.
      Emacs’ dired — directory editor — for browsing the file
      system, along with the new speedbar package that combines
      features from dired and imenu round off the suite of
      navigational tools.</p>

    <div class="subsection-level-extent" id=

      <h4 class="subsection"><span>7.3.4 Everything Is Searchable:

      <p>Emacs derives one final advantage from using buffers as
      the basic building block for the entire desktop. Every Emacs
      buffer is searchable via a uniform and powerful search
      interface. Emacs’ incremental search works efficiently and
      consistently to enable you locate “objects” of interest
      either within a given document or to locate a given object
      from among the various objects that are currently open on the
      Emacspeak desktop. This is <b class="b">very powerful</b> —
      where a <abbr class="acronym" title=
      "Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> (Graphical User
      Interface) user is typically limited to quickly locating an
      object from a relatively small collection — the size of the
      collection being a direct function of available display
      real-estate — the Emacspeak user can typically work with a
      far larger collection of objects. This is well-suited to the
      eyes-free environment, where display real-estate has no
      meaning; so bringing up a list of currently open buffers and
      performing an incremental search to locate a specific buffer
      is just as efficient independent of whether you have a few
      dozen or a few hundred buffers open.</p>
      <p>To illustrate the above, my typical working Emacs session
      lasts between two and three weeks — over that time I
      typically accumulate several hundred open buffers holding a
      large variety of content ranging from program source code to
      email messages and <abbr class="acronym">WWW</abbr>
      pages.</p>
      <p>Ubiquitous search in the eyes-free environment is critical
      — as a comparison, when using a conventional, purely visual
      WWW browser, users have no means of easily “searching” for
      say the “submit” button on a WWW page. This inability is a
      minor annoyance in visual interaction, and the typical
      mouse-enabled user <b class="b">never</b> uses the find
      dialog to find a submit button — it is simply more efficient
      to point at the submit button given the eye’s ability to
      quickly scan the two-dimensional display. This luxury is
      absent in an eyes-free environment; as a consequence, blind
      users confronted by the combination of a visual interface and
      screen-reader are typically limited to either tabbing through
      all the controls on a <abbr class="acronym">WWW</abbr> page,
      or using the sub-optimal find dialog.</p>
