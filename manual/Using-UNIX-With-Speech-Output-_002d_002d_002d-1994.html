    <p>As a graduate student at <a class="url" href=
    "http://www.cs.cornell.edu/info/people/raman/raman.html">Cornell</a>,
    I accessed my Unix workstation (SunOS) from an Intel 486 PC
    running IBM Screen-Reader. There was no means of directly using
    a UNIX box at the time; after graduating, I continued doing the
    same for about six months at Digital Research in Cambridge —
    the only difference being that my desktop workstation was now a
    DEC-Alpha. Throughout this time, Emacs was my environment of
    choice for everything from software development and Internet
    access to writing documents.</p>
    <p>In fall of 1994, I wanted to start using a laptop running
    Linux; a colleague (Dave Wecker) was retiring his 386mhz laptop
    that already had Linux on it and I decided to inherit it. But
    there was only one problem — until then I had always accessed a
    UNIX machine from a secondary PC running a screen-reader —
    something that would clearly make no sense with a laptop!</p>
    <p>Another colleague, Win Treese, had pointed out the
    interesting possibilities presented by package <strong class=
    "strong">advice</strong> in Emacs 19.23 — a few weeks earlier,
    he had sent around a small snippet of code that magically
    modified Emacs’ version-control primitive to first create an
    <em class="emph">RCS</em> directory if none existed before
    adding a file to version control. When I speculated about using
    the Linux laptop, Dave remarked — you live in Emacs anyway —
    why dont you just make it talk!</p>
    <p>Connecting the dots, I decided to write myself a tool that
    augmented Emacs’ default behavior to <em class=
    "emph">speak</em> — within about 4 hours, version 0.01 of
    Emacspeak was up and running.</p>
