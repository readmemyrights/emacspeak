    Programming Defensively</h4>
    <p>As an aside, note that all of Emacspeak has been developed
    over the last 20 years with Emacspeak being the only adaptive
    technology on my system. This has led to some interesting
    design consequences, primary among them being a strong
    education in <strong class="strong">programming
    defensively</strong>. Here are some other key features of the
    Emacspeak code-base:</p>
    <ol class="enumerate">
      <li>The code-base is extremely <strong class=
      "strong">bushy</strong> rather than deeply hierarchical —
      this means that when a module breaks, it does not affect the
      rest of the system.</li>
      <li>Separation of concerns with respect to the various
      layers, a tightly knit core speech library interfaces with
      any one of many speech servers running as an external
      process.</li>
      <li>Audio formatting is abstracted by using the formalism
      defined in Aural CSS.</li>
      <li>Emacspeak integrates with Emacs’ user interface
      conventions by taking over a single prefix key <strong class=
      "strong">C-e</strong> with <em class="emph">all</em>
      Emacspeak commands accessed through that single keymap. This
      helps embedding Emacspeak functionality into a large variety
      of third party modules without any loss of
      functionality.</li>
