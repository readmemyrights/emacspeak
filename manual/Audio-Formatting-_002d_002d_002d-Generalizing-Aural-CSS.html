    <p>A key idea in Audio System For Technical Readings <a class=
    "url" href=
    "http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/aster/aster-toplevel.html">
    (AsTeR)</a> was the use of various voice properties in
    combination with non-speech auditory icons to create rich aural
    renderings. When I implemented Emacspeak, I brought over the
    notion of audio formatting to all buffers in Emacs by creating
    a <strong class="strong">voice-lock</strong> module that
    paralleled Emacs’ <strong class="strong">font-lock</strong>
    module. The visual medium is far richer in terms of available
    fonts and colors as compared to voice parameters available on
    TTS engines — consequently, it did not make sense to directly
    map Emacs’ <strong class="strong">face</strong> properties to
    voice parameters. To aid in projecting visual formatting onto
    auditory space, I created property <strong class=
    "strong">personality</strong> analogous to Emacs’
    <strong class="strong">face</strong> property that could be
    applied to content displayed in Emacs; module <strong class=
    "strong">voice-lock</strong> applied that property
    appropriately, and the Emacspeak core handled the details of
    mapping personality values to the underlying TTS engine.</p>
    <p>The values used in property <strong class=
    "strong">personality</strong> were abstract, i.e., they were
    independent of any given speech engine. Later in the fall of
    1995, I re-expressed these set of abstract voice properties in
    terms of Aural CSS; the work was published as a first draft
    toward the end of 1995, and implemented in Emacs-W3 in early
    1996. Aural CSS was an appendix in the CSS-1.0 specification;
    later, it graduated to being its own module within CSS-2.0.</p>
    <p>Later in 1996, all of Emacs’ <strong class=
    "strong">voice-lock</strong> functionality was re-implemented
    in terms of Aural CSS; the implementation has stood the test of
    time in that as I added support for more TTS engines, I was
    able to implement engine-specific mappings of Aural-CSS values.
    This meant that the rest of Emacspeak could define various
    types of voices for use in specific contexts without having to
    worry about individual TTS engines. Conceptually, property
    <strong class="strong">personality</strong> can be thought of
    as holding an <strong class="strong">aural display
    list</strong> — various parts of the system can annotate pieces
    of text with relevant properties that finally get rendered in
    the aggregate. This model also works well with the notion of
    Emacs overlays where a moving overlay is used to temporarily
    highlight text that has other context-specific properties
    applied to it.</p>
    <p>Audio formatting as implemented in Emacspeak is extremely
    effective when working with all types of content ranging from
    richly structured mark-up documents (LaTeX, org-mode) and
    formatted Web pages to program source code. Perceptually,
    switching to audio formatted output feels like switching from a
    black-and-white monitor to a rich color display. Today,
    Emacspeak’s audio formatted output is the only way I can
    correctly write <strong class="strong">else if</strong> vs
    <strong class="strong">elsif</strong> in various programming
    languages!</p>
