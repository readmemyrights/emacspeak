<p>A key idea in Audio System For Technical Readings <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/aster/aster-toplevel.html">(AsTeR)</a> was the
use of various voice properties in combination with non-speech
auditory icons to create rich aural renderings. When I
implemented Emacspeak, I brought over the notion of audio
formatting to all buffers in Emacs by creating a <strong>voice-lock</strong>
module that paralleled Emacs&rsquo; <strong>font-lock</strong> module. The visual
medium is far richer in terms of available fonts and colors as
compared to voice parameters available on TTS engines  &mdash; 
consequently, it did not make sense to directly map Emacs&rsquo; <strong>face</strong>
properties to voice parameters. To aid in projecting visual
formatting onto auditory space, I created property <strong>personality</strong>
analogous to Emacs&rsquo; <strong>face</strong> property that could be applied to
content displayed in Emacs; module <strong>voice-lock</strong> applied that
property appropriately, and the Emacspeak core handled the
details of mapping personality values to the underlying TTS
engine.
</p>
<p>The values used in property <strong>personality</strong> were abstract, i.e.,
they were independent of any given speech engine. Later in the
fall of 1995, I re-expressed these set of abstract voice
properties in terms of Aural CSS; the work was published as a
first draft toward the end of 1995, and implemented in Emacs-W3
in early 1996. Aural CSS was an appendix in the CSS-1.0
specification; later, it graduated to being its own module within
CSS-2.0.
</p>
<p>Later in 1996, all of Emacs&rsquo; <strong>voice-lock</strong> functionality was
re-implemented in terms of Aural CSS; the implementation has
stood the test of time in that as I added support for more TTS
engines, I was able to implement engine-specific mappings of
Aural-CSS values. This meant that the rest of Emacspeak could
define various types of voices for use in specific contexts
without having to worry about individual TTS
engines. Conceptually, property <strong>personality</strong> can be thought of
as holding an <strong>aural display list</strong>  &mdash;  various parts of the system
can annotate pieces of text with relevant properties that finally
get rendered in the aggregate. This model also works well with
the notion of Emacs overlays where a moving overlay is used to
temporarily highlight text that has other context-specific
properties applied to it.
</p>

<p>Audio formatting as implemented in Emacspeak is extremely
effective when working with all types of content ranging from
richly structured mark-up documents (LaTeX, org-mode) and
formatted Web pages to program source code. Perceptually,
switching to audio formatted output feels like switching from a
black-and-white monitor to a rich color display. Today,
Emacspeak&rsquo;s audio formatted output is the only way I can
correctly write <strong>else if</strong> vs <strong>elsif</strong> in various programming
languages!
