    <h4 class="subsection">10.4.1 Intro</h4>
    <p>Web browsing in emacspeak can be made as simple or as
    complicated as you wish to make it. On the one hand, all that
    need be done is to open a web browser and fetch a particular
    url. This works fine in many cases with exceptions being things
    like html tables. On the other hand, if you spend a little time
    learning a particular browser and its functionality, web
    browsing can be made more efficient and the web more
    navigable.</p>
    <p>This document is intended to be an introduction to the 2
    primary browsers that run under emacs: emacs/w3 and EWW. I also
    intend to introduce a couple of add-on packages intended to
    make life easier and to address specific shortcomings.</p>
    <p>The primary reason for this documentation is the fact that a
    lot of the documentation of the various functions tells exactly
    what it does, but not why or in what circumstance one might use
    it. Hopefully I can remedy that here.</p><span id=
    "Who-this-document-is-intended-for"></span>
    <h3 class="heading">Who this document is intended for</h3>
    <p>While this document is geared toward emacspeak users, it
    might be helpful for other users as well. I have tried to note
    where functions are specific to emacspeak.</p><span id=
    "Assumptions"></span>
    <h3 class="heading">Assumptions</h3>
    <p>This document assumes emacs is installed. If reading the
    section on a particular browser and trying out the associated
    functions, it, of course, assumes that the browser is installed
    and working. For features specific to emacspeak, a working
    install of emacspeak is necessary. It is far beyond the scope
    of this document to help with the installation of these
    programs.</p>
    <p>For help with installing any of the above bits of software,
    the following mailing lists and / or newsgroups are
    available:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>emacs - <code>gnu.emacs.help</code></li>
      <li>emacs/w3 - the mailing list for w3 is pretty dead. Sorry.
      The documentation is, however, not terrible.</li>
      <li>emacspeak - see <a href=
      "http://emacspeak.sf.net">http://emacspeak.sf.net</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is highly suggested that the mailing list archives,
    google, and the relevant documentation be consulted before
    posting messages to any mailing list. Nothing is more
    irritating than answering the same questions over and over.
    Those of you with kids know what I am talking about.</p>
    <p>It is also assumed that the reader is comfortable with using
    emacs itself. Understanding the convention for communicating
    keystrokes to run commands, navigating documents, and the like
    are not covered.</p>
