    <h3 class="section" id="Voice-Lock-Mode">6.5 Voice Lock
    Mode</h3>
    <p>The status of voice lock mode can be toggled on and off in
    the current buffer by issuing the command <kbd class="kbd">C-e
    d v</kbd> (M-x voice-lock-toggle).</p>
    <p>Voice-lock is turned on automatically in all buffers that
    support it when Emacspeak is started.</p>
    <p>Emacspeak can be set to disable voice lock in all of the
    major modes that support it. To do so, insert the following
    statement into your Emacs initialization file:</p>
    <div class="example lisp">
      <pre class="lisp-preformatted">(global-voice-lock-mode -1)
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>The characteristics of the different voice personalities
    used by voice lock mode vary according to the capabilities of
    the speech synthesizer. The definitions applicable to the
    Dectalk family of synthesizers are contained in <samp class=
    "file">dectalk-voices.el</samp>, which is supplied as part of
    the Emacspeak distribution. The Emacspeak distribution also
    contains voice definitions for many other synthesizers.</p>
    <p>Using voice lock mode, Emacspeak also supports many of the
    aural style properties defined in level 2 of the World Wide Web
    Consortium’s Cascading Style Sheet specification (see <a class=
    "url" href=
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/</a>.
    Thus, when Emacspeak is running in conjunction with a
    cooperating user agent, such as William Perry’s Emacspeak/W3
    web browser, the rendering of HTML documents can be regulated
    by style sheets. Examples of style rules which employ the CSS
    audio properties can be found in the default style sheet which
    is supplied in the Emacs/W3 distribution.</p>
