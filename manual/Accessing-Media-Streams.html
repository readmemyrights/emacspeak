    Accessing Media Streams <a class="copiable-link" href=

    <p>Streaming real-time audio on the Internet became a reality
    with the advent of RealAudio in 1995; soon there were a large
    number of media streams available on the Internet ranging from
    music streams to live radio stations. But there was an
    interesting twist — for the most part, all of these media
    streams expected one to look at the screen, even though the
    primary content was purely audio (streaming video hadn’t
    arrived yet!). Starting in 1996, Emacspeak started including a
    variety of eyes-free front-ends for accessing media streams.
    Initially, this was achieved by building a wrapper around
    <strong class="strong">trplayer</strong> — a headless version
    of RealPlayer; later I built Emacspeak module <strong class=
    "strong">emacspeak-m-player</strong> for interfacing with
    package <strong class="strong">mplayer</strong>. A key aspect
    of streaming media integration in emacspeak is that one can
    launch and control streams without ever switching away from
    one’s primary task; thus, you can continue to type email or
    edit code while seamlessly launching and controlling media
    streams. Over the years, Emacspeak has come to integrate with
    Emacs packages like <strong class="strong">emms</strong> as
    well as providing wrappers for <strong class=
    "strong">mplayer</strong> and <strong class=
    "strong">alsaplayer</strong> — collectively, these let you
    efficiently launch all types of media streams, including
    streaming video, without having to explicitly switch
    context.</p>
    <p>In the mid-90’s, Emacspeak started including a directory of
    media links to some of the more popular radio stations —
    primarily as a means of helping users getting started — Emacs’
    ability to rapidly complete directory and file-names turned out
    to be the most effective means of quickly launching everything
    from streaming radio stations to audio books. And even better —
    as the Emacs community develops better and smarter ways of
    navigating the filesystem using completions, e.g., package
    <strong class="strong">ido</strong>, these types of actions
    become even more efficient!</p>
