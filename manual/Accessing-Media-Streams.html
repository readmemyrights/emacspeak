<span id="Accessing-Media-Streams-1"></span><h3 class="section">15.10 Accessing Media Streams</h3>

<p>Streaming real-time audio on the Internet became a reality with
the advent of RealAudio in 1995; soon there were a large number
of media streams available on the Internet ranging from music
streams to live radio stations. But there was an interesting
twist  &mdash;  for the most part, all of these media streams expected
one to look at the screen, even though the primary content was
purely audio (streaming video hadn&rsquo;t arrived yet!). Starting in
1996, Emacspeak started including a variety of eyes-free
front-ends for accessing media streams. Initially, this was
achieved by building a wrapper around <strong>trplayer</strong>  &mdash;  a headless
version of RealPlayer; later I built Emacspeak module
<strong>emacspeak-m-player</strong> for interfacing with package <strong>mplayer</strong>. A
key aspect of streaming media integration in emacspeak is that
one can launch and control streams without ever switching away
from one&rsquo;s primary task; thus, you can continue to type email or
edit code while seamlessly launching and controlling media
streams. Over the years, Emacspeak has come to integrate with
Emacs packages like <strong>emms</strong> as well as providing wrappers for
<strong>mplayer</strong> and <strong>alsaplayer</strong>  &mdash;  collectively, these let you
efficiently launch all types of media streams, including
streaming video, without having to explicitly switch context.
</p>

<p>In the mid-90&rsquo;s, Emacspeak started including a directory of media
links to some of the more popular radio stations  &mdash;  primarily as a
means of helping users getting started  &mdash;  Emacs&rsquo; ability to
rapidly complete directory and file-names turned out to be the
most effective means of quickly launching everything from
streaming radio stations to audio books. And even better  &mdash;  as the
Emacs community develops better and smarter ways of navigating
the filesystem using completions, e.g., package <strong>ido</strong>, these
types of actions become even more efficient!
