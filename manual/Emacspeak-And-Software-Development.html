    <h3 class="section">16.5 Emacspeak And Software
    Development</h3>
    <p>Version 0.01 of Emacspeak was written using IBM
    Screen-Reader on a PC with a terminal emulator accessing a UNIX
    workstation. But in about 2 weeks, Emacspeak was already a
    better environment for developing Emacspeak in particular and
    software development in general. Here are a few highlights in
    1994 that made Emacspeak a good software development
    environment, present-day users of Emacspeak will see that that
    was just scratching the surface.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Audio formatting using voice-lock to provide aural syntax
      highlighting.</li>
      <li>Succinct auditory icons to provide efficient
      feedback.</li>
      <li>Emacs’ ability to navigate code structurally —</li>
    </ul>
    <p>as opposed to moving around by plain-text units such as
    characters, lines and words. S-Expressions are a major win!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Emacs’ ability to specialize behavior based on major and
      minor modes.</li>
      <li>Ability to browse program code using tags, and getting
      fluent spoken feedback.</li>
      <li>Completion <strong>everywhere</strong>.</li>
      <li>Everything is searchable — this is a huge win when you
      cannot see the screen.</li>
      <li>Interactive spell-checking using ISpell with continuous
      spoken feedback augmented by aural highlights.</li>
      <li>Running code compilation and being able to jump to errors
      with spoken feedback.</li>
      <li>Ability to move through diff chunks when working with
      source code and source control systems; refined diffs as
      provided by the <strong>ediff</strong> package when
      speech-enabled is a major productivity win.</li>
      <li>Ability to easily move between email, document authoring
      and programming — though this may appear trivial, it
      continues to be one of Emacs’ biggest wins.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Long-term Emacs users will recognize all of the above as
    being among the reasons why they do most things inside Emacs —
    there is little that is Emacspeak specific in the above list —
    except that Emacspeak was able to provide fluent,
    well-integrated contextual feedback for all of these tasks. And
    that was a game-changer given what I had had before Emacspeak.
    As a case in point, I did not dare program in Python before I
    speech-enabled Emacs’ Python-Mode; the fact that white space is
    significant in Python made it difficult to program using a
    plain screen-reader that was unaware of the semantics of the
    underlying content being accessed.</p>
