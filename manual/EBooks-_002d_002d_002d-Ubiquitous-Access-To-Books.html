    <p>AsTeR — was motivated by the increasing availability of
    technical material as online electronic documents. While AsTeR
    processed the TeX family of markup languages, more general
    ebooks came in a wide range of formats, ranging from plain text
    generated from various underlying file formats to structured
    EBooks, with Project <a class="url" href=
    "http://www.gutenberg.org/">Gutenberg</a> leading the way.
    During the mid-90’s, I had access to a wide range of electronic
    materials from sources such as O’Reilly Publishing and various
    electronic journals — The Perl Journal (TPJ) is one that I
    still remember fondly.</p>
    <p>Emacspeak provided fairly light-weight but efficient access
    to all of the electronic books I had on my local disk — Emacs’
    strengths with respect to browsing textual documents meant that
    I needed to build little that was specific to Emacspeak. The
    late 90’s saw the arrival of Daisy as an XML-based format for
    accessible electronic books. The last decade has seen the rapid
    convergence to <strong class="strong">epub</strong> as a
    distribution format of choice for electronic books. Emacspeak
    provides interaction modes that make organizing, searching and
    reading these materials on the Emacspeak Audio Desktop a
    pleasant experience. Emacspeak also provides an OCR-Mode — this
    enables one to call out to an external OCR program and read the
    content efficiently.</p>
    <p>The somewhat informal process used by publishers like
    O’Reilly to make technical material available to users with
    print impairments was later formalized by <a class="url" href=
    "https://www.bookshare.org/">BookShare</a> — today, qualified
    users can obtain a large number of books and periodicals
    initially as Daisy-3 and increasingly as <strong class=
    "strong">EPub</strong>. BookShare provides a RESTful API for
    searching and downloading books; Emacspeak module
    <strong class="strong">emacspeak-bookshare</strong> implements
    this API to create a client for browsing the BookShare library,
    downloading and organizing books locally, and an integrated
    ebook reading mode to round off the experience.</p>
    <p>A useful complement to this suite of tools is the Calibre
    package for organizing ones ebook collection; Emacspeak now
    implements an <strong class="strong">EPub Interaction</strong>
    mode that leverages Calibre (actually sqlite3) to search and
    browse books, along with an integrated <strong class=
    "strong">EPub mode</strong> for reading books.</p>
