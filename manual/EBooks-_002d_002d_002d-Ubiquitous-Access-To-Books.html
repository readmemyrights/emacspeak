<p>AsTeR  &mdash;  was motivated by the increasing availability of technical
material as online electronic documents. While AsTeR processed
the TeX family of markup languages, more general ebooks came in a
wide range of formats, ranging from plain text generated from
various underlying file formats to structured EBooks, with
Project <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Gutenberg</a> leading the way. During the mid-90&rsquo;s, I had
access to a wide range of electronic materials from sources such
as O&rsquo;Reilly Publishing and various electronic journals  &mdash;  The Perl
Journal (TPJ) is one that I still remember fondly.
</p>
<p>Emacspeak provided fairly light-weight but efficient access to
all of the electronic books I had on my local disk  &mdash;  Emacs&rsquo;
strengths with respect to browsing textual documents meant that I
needed to build little that was specific to Emacspeak. The late
90&rsquo;s saw the arrival of Daisy as an XML-based format for
accessible electronic books. The last decade has seen the rapid
convergence to <strong>epub</strong> as a distribution format of choice for
electronic books. Emacspeak provides interaction modes that make
organizing, searching and reading these materials on the
Emacspeak Audio Desktop a pleasant experience. Emacspeak also
provides an OCR-Mode  &mdash;  this enables one to call out to an
external OCR program and read the content efficiently.
</p>
<p>The somewhat informal process used by publishers like O&rsquo;Reilly to
make technical material available to users with print impairments
was later formalized by <a href="https://www.bookshare.org/">BookShare</a>  &mdash;  today, qualified users can
obtain a large number of books and periodicals initially as
Daisy-3 and increasingly as <strong>EPub</strong>. BookShare provides a RESTful
API for searching and downloading books; Emacspeak module
<strong>emacspeak-bookshare</strong> implements this API to create a client for
browsing the BookShare library, downloading and organizing books
locally, and an integrated ebook reading mode to round off the
experience.
</p>
<p>A useful complement to this suite of tools is the Calibre package
for organizing ones ebook collection; Emacspeak now implements an
<strong>EPub Interaction</strong> mode that leverages Calibre (actually sqlite3)
to search and browse books, along with an integrated <strong>EPub mode</strong>
for reading books.
