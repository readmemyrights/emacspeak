    <h4 class="subsection">10.2.1 Outline Editing</h4>
    <p>All of the various outline editing interfaces on the Emacs
    desktop allow the user to <em>hide</em> or <em>show</em> the
    contents at the different levels of a possibly nested tree
    structure. Components of this tree structure can be manipulated
    as a unit, e.g., entire subtrees can be deleted or copied.
    Outline editing thus provides an efficient means of obtaining
    quick overviews of a document.</p>
    <p>The visual interface displays such hidden content as a
    series of ellipses following the visible outline heading.
    Emacspeak produces auditory icon <em>ellipses</em> when
    speaking such outline headings.</p>
    <p>The basic <em>outline mode</em> allows the user to specify
    the syntax and level of outline header lines as a regular
    expression. This simple technique can be used to advantage in
    the structured navigation of large electronic texts such as
    those available on the Internet from online book projects such
    as project Gutenberg and the Internet Wiretap. For example,
    when this feature is activated while reading the electronic
    text of a Shakespearean play, the different acts can be
    recognized as separate nodes in the logical structure of the
    document. The user can then hide the document body with a
    single keystroke, navigate the outline headings to find a
    particular act, and have that portion rendered either visually
    or aurally. Hiding an outline level produces auditory icon
    <em>close-object</em>; exposing a hidden level produces
    auditory icon <em>open-object</em>. For details on using mode
    <code>outline</code>, see the relevant section of the online
    Emacs info manual.</p>
    <p>The basic outline facility described above is applicable to
    all content being edited or browsed on the Emacspeak desktop.
    In addition, Emacspeak has other specialized outline editing
    modes such as <em>folding mode</em> that provide extended
    outlining facilities. In mode <em>folding</em>, the user can
    create (possibly nested) <em>folds</em> — logical containers of
    content that are delimited by a special <em>fold mark</em>. The
    fold mark is typically a text string that is chosen based on
    the type of content that is being manipulated. Thus, when
    <em>folding</em> a C~program source file, fold marks are
    created from C~comments. The user can <em>open</em> or
    <em>close</em> any or all folds in a document, and these
    actions are accompanied by auditory icons <em>open-object</em>
    and <em>close-object</em>. By entering a fold, all editing
    actions are restricted to the contents of that fold; this
    proves a simple yet convenient way of constraining editing
    actions such as search and replace to specific portions of
    large documents. Folds can be manipulated as a unit and can be
    deleted, copied or moved.</p>
    <p>Mode <em>folding</em> proves especially effective in
    maintaining large software modules. The technique can be used
    to advantage by creating folds for different sections in a
    module and by further placing each function appearing in a
    particular section in a fold of its own. Complex functions can
    themselves be folded into sections where each section reflects
    a different stage in the algorithm implemented by that
    function. Thus, the technique of folding can be used as an
    effective aid in <em>literate</em> programming. I typically
    write software modules by first creating an outline structure
    using folds that reflect the various components of that module.
    Next, I populate each fold with the function signatures and
    documentation for the functions in each section. When I am
    satisfied with the overall architecture of the module, I fill
    in the function skeletons with actual program code. This
    technique is used extensively in maintaining the Emacspeak code
    base.</p>
