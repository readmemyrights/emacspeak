    <h4 class="subsection" id="Outline-Editing-1">10.2.1 Outline
    Editing</h4>
    <p>All of the various outline editing interfaces on the Emacs
    desktop allow the user to <em class="emph">hide</em> or
    <em class="emph">show</em> the contents at the different levels
    of a possibly nested tree structure. Components of this tree
    structure can be manipulated as a unit, e.g., entire subtrees
    can be deleted or copied. Outline editing thus provides an
    efficient means of obtaining quick overviews of a document.</p>
    <p>The visual interface displays such hidden content as a
    series of ellipses following the visible outline heading.
    Emacspeak produces auditory icon <em class="emph">ellipses</em>
    when speaking such outline headings.</p>
    <p>The basic <em class="emph">outline mode</em> allows the user
    to specify the syntax and level of outline header lines as a
    regular expression. This simple technique can be used to
    advantage in the structured navigation of large electronic
    texts such as those available on the Internet from online book
    projects such as project Gutenberg and the Internet Wiretap.
    For example, when this feature is activated while reading the
    electronic text of a Shakespearean play, the different acts can
    be recognized as separate nodes in the logical structure of the
    document. The user can then hide the document body with a
    single keystroke, navigate the outline headings to find a
    particular act, and have that portion rendered either visually
    or aurally. Hiding an outline level produces auditory icon
    <em class="emph">close-object</em>; exposing a hidden level
    produces auditory icon <em class="emph">open-object</em>. For
    details on using mode <code class="code">outline</code>, see
    the relevant section of the online Emacs info manual.</p>
    <p>The basic outline facility described above is applicable to
    all content being edited or browsed on the Emacspeak desktop.
    In addition, Emacspeak has other specialized outline editing
    modes such as <em class="emph">folding mode</em> that provide
    extended outlining facilities. In mode <em class=
    "emph">folding</em>, the user can create (possibly nested)
    <em class="emph">folds</em> — logical containers of content
    that are delimited by a special <em class="emph">fold
    mark</em>. The fold mark is typically a text string that is
    chosen based on the type of content that is being manipulated.
    Thus, when <em class="emph">folding</em> a C~program source
    file, fold marks are created from C~comments. The user can
    <em class="emph">open</em> or <em class="emph">close</em> any
    or all folds in a document, and these actions are accompanied
    by auditory icons <em class="emph">open-object</em> and
    <em class="emph">close-object</em>. By entering a fold, all
    editing actions are restricted to the contents of that fold;
    this proves a simple yet convenient way of constraining editing
    actions such as search and replace to specific portions of
    large documents. Folds can be manipulated as a unit and can be
    deleted, copied or moved.</p>
    <p>Mode <em class="emph">folding</em> proves especially
    effective in maintaining large software modules. The technique
    can be used to advantage by creating folds for different
    sections in a module and by further placing each function
    appearing in a particular section in a fold of its own. Complex
    functions can themselves be folded into sections where each
    section reflects a different stage in the algorithm implemented
    by that function. Thus, the technique of folding can be used as
    an effective aid in <em class="emph">literate</em> programming.
    I typically write software modules by first creating an outline
    structure using folds that reflect the various components of
    that module. Next, I populate each fold with the function
    signatures and documentation for the functions in each section.
    When I am satisfied with the overall architecture of the
    module, I fill in the function skeletons with actual program
    code. This technique is used extensively in maintaining the
    Emacspeak code base.</p>
