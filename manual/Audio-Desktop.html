    Emacspeak Audio Desktop.</h2><a class="index-entry-id" id=
    "index-Audio-Desktop"></a>
    <p>This chapter describes the Emacspeak audio desktop and gives
    tips and tricks for making use of many of Emacs’ powerful
    features.</p>
    <p>The desktop is the work area where you organize the tools of
    your trade and the information objects relevant to your current
    activities. In the conventional world of visual <abbr class=
    "acronym" title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>
    (Graphical User Interface)-based computing, these tools and
    information objects manifest themselves as a collection of
    icons organized in a two-dimensional work-area — this
    organization is designed to place frequently used objects
    within easy reach.</p>
    <p>Notice that organizing one’s work area in terms of visual
    icons arranged in a two-dimensional area where such an
    organization is optimized for the available “conversational
    gestures” of pointing and clicking is an artifact of visual
    interaction.</p>
    <p>In the spirit of a truly speech-enabled application,
    Emacspeak does not simply provide you spoken access to a
    particular presentation of your work environment that was
    initially designed with the “sign language” of visual
    interaction in mind. Instead, Emacspeak enables you to work
    with documents and other information objects in a manner that
    is optimized to aural, eyes-free interaction. A necessary
    consequence of this setup is that users accustomed to the
    purely visual manifestation of today’s electronic desktop do
    not immediately perceive the Emacspeak environment as an
    electronic desktop. This section of the manual hopes to
    introduce you to a work-style that encourages a different
    perspective on how one interacts with the computer in
    performing day-to-day computing tasks.</p>
    <p>The end result in my case has been a marked increase in
    personal productivity.</p>
