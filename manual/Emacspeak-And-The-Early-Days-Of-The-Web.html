<p>Right around the time that I was writing version 0.01 of
emacspeak, a far more significant software movement was under way
 &mdash;  the World Wide Web was moving from the realms of academia to
the mainstream world with the launch of NCSA Mosaic  &mdash;  and in late
1994 by the first commercial Web browser in Netscape
Navigator. Emacs had always enabled integrated access to FTP
archives via package <em>ange-ftp</em>; in late 1993, William Perry
released Emacs-W3, a Web browser for Emacs written entirely in
Emacs Lisp. W3 was one of the first large packages to be
speech-enabled by Emacspeak  &mdash;  later it was the browser on which I
implemented the first draft of the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/aural.html">Aural CSS
specification</a>. Emacs-W3 enabled many early innovations in the
context of providing non-visual access to Web content, including
audio formatting and structured content navigation; in summer of
1995, Dave Raggett and I outlined a few extensions to HTML Forms,
including the <strong>label</strong> element as a means of associating metadata
with interactive form controls in HTML, and many of these ideas
were prototyped in Emacs-W3 at the time. Over the years, Emacs-W3
fell behind the times  &mdash;  especially as the Web moved away from
cleanly structured HTML to a massive soup of unmatched tags. This
made parsing and error-correcting badly-formed HTML markup
expensive to do in Emacs-Lisp  &mdash;  and performance suffered. To add
to this, mainstream users moved away because Emacs&rsquo; rendering
engine at the time was not rich enough to provide the type of
visual renderings that users had come to expect. The advent of
DHTML, and JavaScript based Web Applications finally killed off
Emacs-W3 as far as most Emacs users were concerned.
</p>
<p>But Emacs-W3 went through a revival on the emacspeak audio
desktop in late 1999 with the arrival of XSLT, and Daniel
Veillard&rsquo;s excellent implementation via the <strong>libxml2</strong> and
<strong>libxslt</strong> packages. With these in hand, Emacspeak was able to
hand-off the bulk of HTML error correction to the <strong>xsltproc</strong>
tool. The lack of visual fidelity didn&rsquo;t matter much for an
eyes-free environment; so Emacs-W3 continued to be a useful tool
for consuming large amounts of Web content that did not require
JavaScript support.
</p>
<p>During the last 24 months, <strong>libxml2</strong> has been built into Emacs;
this means that you can now parse arbitrary HTML as found in the
wild without incurring a performance hit. This functionality was
leveraged first by package <strong>shr</strong> (Simple HTML Renderer) within
the <strong>gnus</strong> package for rendering HTML email. Later, the author of
<strong>gnus</strong> and <strong>shr</strong> created a new light-weight HTML viewer called
<strong>eww</strong> that is now part of Emacs 24. With improved support for
variable pitch fonts and image embedding, Emacs is once again
able to provide visual renderings for a large proportion of
text-heavy Web content where it becomes useful for mainstream
Emacs users to view at least some Web content within Emacs;
during the last year, I have added support within emacspeak to
<a href="http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2014/05/emacspeak-eww-updates-for-complete.html">extend package <strong>eww</strong></a> with support for DOM filtering and quick
content navigation.
