    <p>The ability to invoke external processes and interface with
    them via a simple read-eval-loop (REPL) is perhaps one of
    Emacs’ strongest extension points. This means that a wide
    variety of computational tools become immediately available for
    embedding within the Emacs environment — a facility that has
    been widely exploited by the Emacs community. Over the years,
    Emacspeak has leveraged many of these facilities to provide a
    well-integrated auditory interface.</p>
    <p>Starting from a tight code, eval, test form of iterative
    programming as encouraged by Lisp. Applied to languages like
    Python and Ruby to exploratory computational tools such as R
    for data analysis and SQL for database interaction, the
    Emacspeak Audio Desktop has come to encompass a collection of
    rich computational tools that provide an efficient eyes-free
    experience.</p>
    <p>In this context, module <strong class="strong">ein</strong>
    — Emacs IPython Notebooks — provides another excellent example
    of an Emacs tool that helps interface seamlessly with others in
    the technical domain. IPython Notebooks provide an easy means
    of reaching a large audience when publishing technical material
    with interactive computational content; module <strong class=
    "strong">ein</strong> brings the power and convenience of Emacs
    ’ editing facilities when developing the content.
    Speech-enabling package <strong class="strong">ein</strong> is
    a major win since editing program source code in an eyes-free
    environment is far smoother in Emacs than in a browser-based
    editor.</p>
