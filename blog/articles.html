      Summary</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
      <p>
      A collection of keybinding changes I have arrived at over time to
      protect my fingers.Note that I have now used Emacs for more than 33
      years, and some of these changes may well have helped me much
      earlier;
      on the other hand, I likely didn't notice these issues because
      myhands then were not the same as what they are now.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      See earlier articles on this topic for context:

      <ul class="org-ul">

      </ul>
      
      <p>
      So to summarize,  my Emacs uses:
      </p>
      
      <ol class="org-ol">
      <li><b>CapsLock</b> as
      <i>Control</i>.</li>
      <li>Using XCape, quickly releasing <i>Control</i>
      emits <i>C-e</i> &#x2014; the
      eEmacspeak prefix-key.</li>

      <h2 id="orgd0e879a"><span
      class="section-number-2">2.</span> Next, Some
      Finger Tips</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
      <p>
      Note: I'm not a trained ergonomist; the following are
      observations
      based on my experience and may not apply to everyone; I suspect the
      size of one's hands, the width of the keyboard etc., all matter.
      For
      the last 3+ years, I've exclusively used a laptop keyboard, in
      my case
      a Lenovo.
      </p>
      
      <ol class="org-ol">
      <li>I now find that replacing key-chords by a sequence of
      non-chords
      makes my hands happier. The trick is to replace a chord by no
      more than 2 keys.</li>
      <li>Since Caps lock (left pinky) is my
      <i>Control</i> key, <i>C-s</i> is  not
      as nice as <i>C-l</i>; notice that the former requires
      chording with
      two fingres of the same hand, whereas the lattre spreads the work
      among both hands on an English <span
      class="underline">qwerty</span>
      keyboard.</li>
      <li>One work-around for the above might be to have <span
      class="underline">RET</span> emit
      <i>Control</i> if held down,  but I haven't done
      that (yet).</li>
      <li>On the left-hand, chords that require extending or
      scrunching
      one's fingres when hitting a chord are more painful. Thus,
      <i>C-z</i>
      and <i>C-x</i> are more painful to hit than
      <i>C-d</i>. Emacs hardly uses
      <i>C-z</i> and <i>C-c</i>; but
      unfortunately, <i>C-x</i> is an important prefix key in
      stock Emacs.</li>

      Finger Tips</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
      <ol class="org-ol">
      <li>I have <i>left-shift</i> and
      <i>right-shift</i> emit <i>C-s</i> and
      <i>C-r</i>
      using XCape.</li>
      <li>I bound <i>C-l</i> to <span
      class="underline">ctl-x-map</span> (still
      experimental). This remapping
      fails to take effect in places like <i>Dired</i> and
      <i>Gnus</i>.</li>
      <li>I additionally bound <i>find-file</i> to
      <i>C-; o</i>.</li>
      <li>A long time ago, I discovered <i>M-m</i>
      (back-to-indentation) and I
      never hit <i>C-a</i> to move to the start of the
      line.</li>
      <li>When I remap things, I <b>never</b> take away
      the original Emacs
      bindings; I only provide alternatives.</li>
      <li>I use <i>C-,</i>, <i>C-.</i>,
      <i>C-;</i>, and <i>C-'</i> as prefix
      keys. Downside:
      these only work under X, but the time where I only ran Emacs in a
      terminal are long gone.</li>

<h2 id="orgcd9b218"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> Establishing Liberty, Equality And Freedom:</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
  Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all
major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,
distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated
system without any undue pressure—a documented success for
the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system
evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at
the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak
codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform
and the underlying GIT versioning software used to develop and distribute the system.
</p>

<p>
Extensive studies have shown that thanks to these features, users
consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this
wide-spread user demand, the present version remains   free of cost 
as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as
previous releases.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of
eyes-free Assistance and social interaction and carries forward the
well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user interface
features that eventually show up in luser environments.
</p>

<p>
On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a crash-prone
but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion "Emacs is a system from
the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak evinced surprise at the unusual
candor manifest in the assertion that it would take popular
idiot-proven interfaces until the year 2070 to catch up to where the
Emacspeak audio desktop is today. Industry experts welcomed this
refreshing breath of Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time
when users are reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD)
unleashed by complex software systems backed by even more convoluted
press releases.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and
not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without
adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer. These
same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped
functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of
Emacspeak once pointed out that these results re-emphasize the
user-centric design of Emacspeak; “It is the user &#x2014; and not the
computer&#x2013; that stops functioning when Emacspeak is uninstalled!”.

      Background</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
      <p>
      In my previous article <a
      
      href="https://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2023/02/enhance-emacs-ergonomics-under-x-happy.html">Ergonomics Using xcape</a>
      I described my setup to minimize chording  in Emacs. The setup is
      working well, and in the few weeks of usage, I've reduce the
      <code>xcape
      timeout</code> setting from 250ms to 170ms,  this is the
      timeout that
      controls  the behavior of modifier keys in xcape.

      Wheels In Emacs</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
      <p>
      Next, I decided that getting some feedback from Emacs and Emacspeak
      when xcape behavior is triggered would act as <i>training
      wheels</i> while
      getting used to the setup.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      I considered the following:
      </p>
      
      <ol class="org-ol">
      <li>Adding  a feature to <code>xcape</code> that
      produces a sound cue on triggering modified behavior &#x2014;
      would work <i>everywhere</i> in X.</li>
      <li>Having Emacs produce some feedback when xcape behavior is
      triggered.</li>
      <li>Asked on <span
      class="underline">emacs-devel</span> as to how
      one would do this in Emacsand
      was pointed at <code>echo-keystrokes</code> by one of
      the core Emacs maintainers.</li>
      </ol>
      </div>
      </div>

      Solution</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
      <p>
      I phrased my question on emacs-devel as <i>is there an elisp
      hook</i> for
      implementing this.  Turns out no new code is needed; Emacs has a
      <code>echo-keystrokes</code> custom option that controls
      how long Emacs waits
      before displaying an incomplete key-sequence.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      So now, I have <code>echo-keystrokes</code> set to
      <span class="underline">0.05</span>
      &#x2014; and Emacspeak
      speaks the resulting incomplete keystroke that  is displayed  by
      Emacs. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Still playing with various values of
      <code>echo-keystrokes</code> but that is
      easy &#x2014; it's just one custom setting.

      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
      <p>
      I have been using Emacs for 33 years now and at this point, much of
      my
      Emacs usage is based on muscle memory. This has its good and bad
      points; the good ones are obvious; I dont need to think about what
      keys I press. But it also has some downside; I likely press more
      keysthan I ought to for a given result.
      </p>
      
      
      <ol class="org-ol">
      <li>I learn to use Emacs on a TTY (text console) and all my
      habits
      are driven by the keys available on a terminal.</li>
      <li>Under X you have more keys available, but I resisted
      running X
      until around 2008.</li>
      <li>Now, I almost never run Emacs on a TTY, except when I need
      to
      rescue a broken X setup.</li>
      <li>after turning <code>caps_lock</code> to
      <code>Control</code> I forgot about the other
      modifier keys; I press <code>Escape</code> for
      Meta.</li>
      <li>I also defined <code>C-;</code> and friends as
      additional Emacs prefix keys.</li>
      <li>The above saves your hands because you dont chord using
      themodifier keys on the bottom row.</li>
      <li>But  you waste 6 modifier keys on a
      laptop where keys are in short supply.</li>

      Current Keyboard</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
      <ul class="org-ul">
      <li>The motivation to leverage the laptop keyboard is higher
      now,
      since with the arrival of the pandemic, that has been my primary
      (only) machine.</li>
      <li>I can chord without thinking  using the modified
      <code>caps_lock</code>
      as <code>Control</code>.  But I also noticed that I
      <b>choard a lot</b>.</li>
      <li>Chords I use most often as a prefix:
      <ul class="org-ul">
      <li><code>C-e</code> &#x2014; Emacspeak
      prefix,</li>
      <li><code>C-s</code> and
      <code>C-r</code> &#x2014; Isearch,</li>
      <li><code>C-c</code> and
      <code>C-x</code> &#x2014; emacs command
      prefix.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Looking at the bottom row of the laptop keyboard, there
      are three
      modifier keys to either side of the spacebar.</li>
      <li>Adding the left and right <code>Shift</code>
      modifiers gives 8 keys that
      could  do something useful when not used as a modifier
      key.</li>

      I discovered <a

      exploration; The observations made in the previous section indicated

      Looking at the above, it's tempting to turn the

      <li>A week later, I'm slowly retraining my muscle memory
      &#x2014; I use
      the new affordances described here about 25% of the time.</li>
      <li>I find myself using the new features in the second half of
      the day
      when my hands are more tired.</li>
      <li>The effect of <i>thinking</i> before
      <i>pressing</i> a key reminds me of
      the time I learn to use <i>dvorak</i> for text input; I
      still do so
      sometimes to give my hands a break.</li>
      <li>The new mappings give some surprising results
      <i>e.g.</i>, <code>alt</code>
      <code>shift</code> saves the buffer, but buyer beware,
      <code>alt</code> <code>super</code> quits
      Emacs.</li>
      <li>Am sure more muscle memory will emerge for oft-repeated

      <p>
      I access research papers from <a
      href="https://arxiv.org">arxiv.org</a> multiple
      times a week. Having
      originally worked on  access to STEM content for my PhD over 30
      yearsago, I find it both encouraging and challenging as I continue
      to acquire
      access to the research materials I need.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      As the Digital Library of the future, <i>arxiv</i> is
      committed to
      improving the state of STEM Access; see the  
      <a
      
      href="https://info.arxiv.org/about/accessibility_research_report.html">Accessibility</a> report they recently published. A few months
      ago after talking to them about their goals, I wrote down some ideas
      that would make my own access to <i>arxiv</i> a smoother
      experience;
      posting them here so folks in the STEM Accessibility community can
      expand and build on these ideas.

      Easy things are often amusing and relaxing, but their value soon
      fades. Greater pleasure, deeper satisfaction, and higher wages are
      associated with genuine accomplishments, with the successful
      fulfillment of a challenging task.

      Liberty, Equality And Freedom:</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
      <p>
      Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all
      major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,
      distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated
      system without any undue pressure—a documented success for
      the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system
      evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at
      the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak
      codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform
      and the underlying GIT versioning software used to develop and
      distribute the system.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Extensive studies have shown that thanks to these features, users
      consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this
      wide-spread user demand, the present version remains   free of cost 
      as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as
      previous releases.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of
      eyes-free Assistance and social interaction and carries forward the
      well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user interface
      features that eventually show up in luser environments.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a crash-prone
      but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion "Emacs is a
      system from
      the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak evinced surprise at the
      unusual
      candor manifest in the assertion that it would take popular
      idiot-proven interfaces until the year 2070 to catch up to where the
      Emacspeak audio desktop is today. Industry experts welcomed this
      refreshing breath of Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time
      when users are reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD)
      unleashed by complex software systems backed by even more convoluted
      press releases.

      Test Results:</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
      <p>
      Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and
      not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without
      adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer. These
      same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped
      functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of
      Emacspeak once pointed out that these results re-emphasize the
      user-centric design of Emacspeak; “It is the user &#x2014; and
      not the
      computer&#x2013; that stops functioning when Emacspeak is
      uninstalled!”.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
As a student, I learned to take <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/info/people/raman/phd-thesis/html/root-thesis.html">notes in Braille</a> while in class and
while learning from audio books.   When reviewing the material, reading
the notes was far more efficient than re-listening to the original
recordings; however at the time, I had no means to easily jump to the
original content when perusing my notes.
</p>

<p>
Fast-forward to the age of online computing, a complete audio desktop
in the form of Emacspeak, a wealth of online resources in the form of
E-Books, Audio Books, Podcasts and Blogs, all backed by Universal
Search and accessible from a consistent environment. So I've been
asking myself what <i>note-taking</i> in this environment should look like.
This article summarizes the present state of what I use at present.

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>All of the following should work equally well for locally stored
material, e.g., downloaded E-Books from <a href="https://www.bookshare.org/cms/">Bookshare.org</a>  or Project
Gutenberg, as well as material hosted on the Internet in the form of
Blogs and Podcasts.</li>
<li>Create named bookmarks in E-Books (EPub, Daisy).</li>
<li>Create  AMarks —bookmarks  that point to positions in an audio files.</li>
<li>Above should be possible independent of whether the learning
material is available locally, or accessed via the Internet.</li>
<li>Enable the creation of hyperlinks to such bookmarks.</li>
<li>Enable the easy creation of notes — organized by topic — while
reading E-Books  or listening to  audio material.</li>
<li>Enable the embedding of hyperlinks to the bookmarks mentioned
earlier within these notes.</li>
<li>Final experience: creation of notes should require minimal
effort; when reading the notes, it should be  easy to open the
relevant portion of the content that underlies the notes.</li>

<h2><a name="idm145" id="idm145">Goodbye To Tilden Labrador, Our Beloved Press/Analyst Contact
</a></h2>
<div>
<br><h1>Epitaph:  Tilden  Labrador</h1>

<h2>Epitaph</h2>

<p>Tilden Labrador (TilTil) --- he loved the tinkling of bells --- was
born August 4, 2009. I first
met him on the morning  of  July 17, 2011
and he graduated from Guiding Eyes (at home) on Aug  5, 2011.</p>
<p>His pet name was Til-Til (he loved the sound of bells and would
jump up shoulder high if you rang a bell) --- and had a very gentle
personality. He  worked as a guide-dog for 11 years and 1 month
before going to sleep peacefully on September 3, 2022.</p>
<p>During his career, Tilden worked at Google Mountain View and
travelled to multiple Google offices including Seattle, Cambridge and
NYC to name a few. He also had the privilege of sharing at least 10
different desk locations on the Google MTv campus ranging from main
campus all the way to the far end of the Western Spiral Arm of the
Galaxy (AKA West Campus) and the opposite end on East Charleston.  He
travelled around the Google Campus proudly sporting his Google Badge,
but unlike his predecessor Bubbles, would wait if recalcitrant
Googlers blocked his way and look up at them gently as if to say <em>Why
dont you move out of my way please?</em>.
On the other hand, he was also the veritable sphinx in that if he
parked himself outsite the restroom to wait for me, he would look up
at all who  came close to say <em>Thou Shall Not Pass</em>.
He worked on a variety of
AI-powered projects including Google Accessibility, Smart Assistant,
and toward the end on Google Translate, all while bringing his
refreshingly Natural Intelligence to his primary job of path planning
and obstacle avoidance on the Google Campus --- and believe you me, it
takes a particularly intelligent dog to avoid obstacles that smart
Googlers can place in your way.   He attended most Smart Assistant
offsites with the claim <em>All of you have just a Smart Assistant;
But I'm a Smart AssistDog, and that is better, --- because you know, A
Dog is Bigger Than An Ant!</em>
In addition, Tilden, like Aster and
Bubbles before him, was also the mascot for <a
href="http://emacspeak.sf.net">Emacspeak --- The Complete Audio
Desktop</a>; in addition, he  played the vital role of Press/Analyst
contact for just over 11 years.</p>

<p>
Porting  Emacspeak sound environment to Pulseaudio.
</p>

<p>
Until now, emacspeak features that enhance the auditory display have
relied exclusively on ALSA and avoided Pulseaudio all together. As
Pulseaudio improves, and  simultaneously gets harder to get rid of, I
recently ported the required features to work under Pulseaudio, see
below for details.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Notifications, e.g., <i>speaking the time</i>, <i>incoming IM messages</i></li>
</ul>
<p>
etc. are spoken on a separate notification stream.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The above normally plays on the right ear, but enhanced with a
<i>binaural</i> effect.</li>
<li>This can be configured to be on the left ear when running
Emacspeak remotely on a cloud-top.</li>
<li>A <i>Bauer Stereo To Binaural</i> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?num=25&amp;lite=90586&amp;q=bs2b+bauer+Stereo+To+Binaural">(BS2B)</a>
filter is applied to all
output streams to provide an enhanced headphones listening experience.</li>
<li>The <i>outloud</i> server has been updated to request  lower latency
from Pulse; Pulseaudio defaults are too high for highly responsive
TTS.</li>
</ul>

prior articles listed in the <i>References</i> section.

<h2 id="orgc514147"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Configuring Pulseaudio To Enhance The Auditory Display</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
All of these features have been available until now by installing a
custom <code>.asoundrc</code>; these are now available under Pulseaudio by
installing a <code>.config/pulse/default.pa</code> in the user's home directory.
</p>

<pre class="example">
cp EMACSPEAK_DIR/etc/pulse/default.pa ~/.config/pulse; pulseaudio -k
</pre>


<p>
The above is a one-time operation that sets up the audio environment

      Liberty, Equality And Freedom:</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
      <p>
      Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all
      major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,
      distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated
      system without any undue pressure—a documented success for
      the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system
      evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at
      the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak
      codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform
      and the underlying GIT versioning software used to develop and
      distribute the system.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Extensive studies have shown that thanks to these features, users
      consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this
      wide-spread user demand, the present version remains   free of cost 
      as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as
      previous releases.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of
      eyes-free Assistance and social interaction and carries forward the
      well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user interface
      features that eventually show up in luser environments.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a crash-prone
      but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion "Emacs is a
      system from
      the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak evinced surprise at the
      unusual
      candor manifest in the assertion that it would take popular
      idiot-proven interfaces until the year 2070 to catch up to where the
      Emacspeak audio desktop is today. Industry experts welcomed this
      refreshing breath of Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time
      when users are reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD)
      unleashed by complex software systems backed by even more convoluted
      press releases.

      Test Results:</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
      <p>
      Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and
      not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without
      adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer. These
      same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped
      functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of
      Emacspeak once pointed out that these results re-emphasize the
      user-centric design of Emacspeak; “It is the user &#x2014; and
      not the
      computer&#x2013; that stops functioning when Emacspeak is
      uninstalled!”.

      Introduction</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
      <p>
      Love it or hate it, lisp <code>advice</code> is powerful
      and useful.  This
      article covers some of the places where
      <code>advice</code> can provide a means
      of discovering useful behaviors that can then be later codified
      without resorting to advice. Advice can also prove to be a powerful
      means of experimentation; these experiments  can become permanent,
      e.g., when the
      resulting modifications introduced via
      <code>advice</code> are only relevant to a small
      minority &#x2014; a good example is package <a
      
      href="https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak">Emacspeak</a>. These are but two
      extremes of a continuum and <code>advice</code> enables
      many possibilities in
      that range.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      This article is written in the light of nearly 28 years of Emacspeak
      development, a time during which I have learn some useful lessons on
      how to use advice safely and program defensively. 
      This article itself does not take any position in the
      <i>Advice is evil,
      dont use it</i> debate &#x2014; it is here to help you if
      you do decide to use
      <code>advice</code> for a given task.

      <h2 id="org3b61f06"><span
      class="section-number-2">2.</span> Where Advice
      Can Be Useful</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
      <ol class="org-ol">
      <li>Temporarily  <i>trace</i>  a given function
      &#x2014; <code>advice</code> can display
      messages on entry and exit to the advised function. Emacs' own
      built-in debug-on-entry mostly obviates the need to do
      this.</li>
      <li>You want custom  behavior for some command in a package,
      where
      the package author (hasn't yet) provided an appropriate
      <i>before</i>
      or <i>after</i> hook. Implementing the desired behavior
      as a <i>before</i>
      or <i>after</i> advice is a friction-free means of
      experimenting with
      your idea. Once proven useful, the  advice-based prototype can be
      used to motivate the introduction of the new hook, and once
      implemented, you can eliminate the
      <code>advice</code>.</li>
      <li>Having implemented a custom behavior, you discover that
      theauthor of the package you are extending is unable to incorporate
      your suggestion. Advice here can provide a light-weight
      alternative to forking the package in question.</li>
      <li>The modified behavior you wish to implement is relevant to
      a
      small minority. You need to advice a large number of functions
      because the modified behavior you desire requires complete access
      to the calling context and environment. A good example is
      generating rich contextual spoken feedback &#x2014; advice is
      excellently suited to this task.</li>

      Tips</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
      <p>
      These tips are written in terms of
      <code>defadvice</code> but apply equally well
      to the API introduced in module <code>nadvice</code>.
      </p>
      
      <ol class="org-ol">
      <li>Use <code>before/after</code> advice as far as
      possible, and resort to
      <code>around</code> advice only when you
      must.</li><li>Name all your
      <code>advice</code> fragments consistently.</li>
      <li>Do not depend on the argument names used in the function
      being
      advised, instead use <span
      class="underline">ad-get-arg</span> to
      positionally access the advised
      function's arguments.</li>
      <li>Use lexical scoping in all your functions, and be rigorous
      in
      declaring any special variables using <span
      class="underline">(cl-declare (special
      &#x2026;))</span> in your code. The byte-compiler is your
      friend; use this
      declaration when you see warnings about special
      variables.</li><li>Except for very simple advice
      fragments, use a <span
      class="underline">let</span> form inside
      your advice to bind variables.</li>
      <li>Within your advice, do not depend on any global state that
      you
      haven't yourself bound within the <span
      class="underline">let</span> body in your
      advice.</li>
      <li>If you write <code>around</code> advice,
      ensure that the last form in your
      <code>advice</code> is <span
      class="underline">ad-return-value</span>. Dont
      modify this value unless you
      <b>absolutely</b> must.</li>
      <li>Make sure to use <span
      class="underline">ad-do-it</span> in your
      <code>around</code> advice so that the
      original function gets called &#x2014; except in the very rare
      cases 
      where you want to entirely bypass the original function.</li>
      <li>In the rare case where you have multiple <span
      class="underline">defadvice</span> on the same
      function, note that you can specify the order win which these are
      called. Use this only when experimenting, and make sure to
      clean-up later by combining the advice fragments into a single
      call to <code>defadvice</code>.</li>

      Note</h2>

      <ul class="org-ul">
      <li>Advice was contributed to Emacs in early 1994 by Hans
      Chalupsky. I started the Emacspeak project a few months after and
      am indebted to him &#x2014; both for his advice implementation
      and for
      numerous email exchanges with him at the time as I learnt to use 
      advice.</li>
      <li>I released Emacspeak in April 1995. A few days later I was
      thrilled to receive a phone call from RMS &#x2014; where he told
      me all
      the reasons why I shouldn't use advice. This was distressing to
      say the least; I had two choices &#x2014; abandon Emacspeak
      usingadvice, or to ignore his advice. I took the middle-road; I made
      careful note of all his admonitions and warnings, and the result
      was to program defensively. Many of the tips listed in the
      previous section are a direct consequence of keeping an eye out
      for the various pitfalls he outlined during that phone
      call.</li>
      <li>I've also garnered useful tips and tricks on the
      emacs-devel list
      over the  years from folks like Stefan Mounier &#x2014;
      especially as
      Emacs transitioned to module <code>nadvice</code> in
      2014.</li>

      Summary</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
      <p>
      Emacspeak has supported <i>Cloud Computing</i> since
      1995, i.e., long
      before the term was invented.  I have used Emacs with Emacspeak
      running on remote servers (called cloud-top in the rest of this
      article) since that time, with a local speech server on my client
      machine providing spoken feedback.  The underlying ssh-based scripts
      have changed over time; this article documents what I have been
      usingfor the last 7 years or more. As with everything else Linux,
      youshould not use this without understanding how it works. All of
      therelevant code is checked into GitHub, but if you use it without
      understanding, you are likely to get 2 for the price of 1😀.

      <h2 id="orgce224d0"><span
      class="section-number-2">2.</span> The
      Basics</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
      <ol class="org-ol">
      <li>Emacspeak produces all spoken and non-spoken feedback via
      a <i>speech
      server</i> &#x2014; see <a
      
      href="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/raman/publications/bc-emacspeak/">Emacspeak: Beautiful Code</a> for the detailed
      architecture overview.</li>
      <li>This server runs as a separate process and can either run
      <b>locally</b>
      i.e. on the machine running emacs; it can also run
      <b>remotely</b>,
      e.g. your laptop from which  you login to your cloud-top.</li>
      <li>Note the <i>local</i> and
      <i>remote</i> terminology in the above &#x2014; to
      Emacspeak, the machine where Emacs runs is the local machine, so
      your machine in the cloud is <b>local</b> to
      Emacspeak.</li>
      <li>Consequently, the machine from where you SSH to the cloud,
      a
      laptop, a Raspberry Pi, or in a future a tin-can that you use as a
      client is <b>remote</b> to emacspeak.</li>
      </ol>
      </div>
      </div>
      
      <div id="outline-container-org9d1d106"
      class="outline-2">
      <h2 id="org9d1d106"><span
      class="section-number-2">3.</span> How It
      Works</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
      <ol class="org-ol">
      <li>When you start Emacs with Emacspeak loaded, Emacs starts
      the
      speech-server as the first step in the emacspeak startup.
      normally this starts the local server for your  preferred TTS
      engine.</li>
      <li>See the emacspeak manual for how this speech-server is
      determined.</li>
      <li>When running Emacspeak on a cloud-top, this <i>local
      speech server</i> is just a
      simple shell script that connects to a local port  &#x2014; by
      default    <b>2222</b>.</li>
      <li>When you connect to your cloud-top via SSH, you first
      <i>reverse port
      forward</i> port <b>2222</b> from the cloud-top
      back to your client. This
      causes data sent to port <b>2222</b> on the cloud-top by
      Emacs to show
      up on port <b>2222</b> on the local machine where your
      speech server is listening.</li>
      <li>With that reverse port forwarding in place and assuming
      that
      <code>espeak</code> is your TTS engine, running the
      speech-server
      <code>cloud-espeak</code> on the cloud-top connects back
      to your client to
      produce spoken output.</li>
      <li>For the previous step to work, something (or someone)
      needs to be
      listening on port <b>2222</b> on your client.</li>
      <li><p>
      So you need to start the relevant speech server  on your client
      before you <code>ssh</code> to your cloud-top
      &#x2014; in the case of <code>espeak</code>,
      this is <code>ssh-espeak</code>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      See directory <code>bash-utils</code> in your emacspeak
      Git checkout for the
      relevant Bash scripts.
      </p></li>

      class="outline-2">
      <h2 id="org81b1ca8"><span
      class="section-number-2">4.</span>
      Workflow</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
      <p>
      Here is what the workflow looks like, again, use this <b>only
      if</b>
      you have read and understood the previous section.
      See<a
      
      href="https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak/blob/master/bash-utils/remote#L8">Bash Utils</a> for the scripts mentioned below. Everything below
      assumes a Bash Shell.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      On your cloud-top, specify the speech-server to use by running
      </p>
      
      <pre class="example">
      export DTK_PROGRAM=cloud-espeak
      </pre>
      
      
      <p>
      You can put the above in your 
      <code>.bash_profile</code> on your cloud-top.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      On your client device, run
      </p>
      
      <pre class="example">
      . &lt;emacspeak_dir&gt;/bash-utils/remote
      </pre>
      
      
      <p>
      This need be done only once per interactive shell.It defines
      <code>bash</code>
      functions <span
      class="underline">remote</span> and <span
      class="underline">rtts</span>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Next, run  Bash function <span
      class="underline">remote</span> defined in the
      script you just
      loaded.
      </p>
      
      <pre class="example">
      remote host.example.com  speech-server espeak
      </pre>
      
      
      <p>
      This does the following:
      </p>
      
      <ol class="org-ol">
      <li>Starts a local speech server for the TTS engine
      <code>espeak</code>.</li>
      <li>Opens an SSH session to the cloud-top
      host.example.com.</li>
      <li>Plays a musical chime (using <code>sox</code>)
      to cue completion.</li>
      <li>Depending on your SSH setup, you may or may not need to
      type your
      ssh password at this point; avoiding having to type a password is
      beyond the purview of this article, consult the SSH manual
      pages.</li>
      <li>Now, run Emacs on  the cloud-top. Assuming that you have
      updated
      your Emacs initialization to load Emacspeak, this will get
      Emacspeak running on   the cloud-top talking on your
      client.</li>
      <li>Note that typically, you should run something like
      <code>screen</code> on the
      cloud-top and run Emacs within that <code>screen</code>
      session; this will let
      you persist a running Emacs across multiple login/logout.</li>

      <li>Run the bash function that starts the local TTS server,
      and then

      Liberty, Equality And Freedom:</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
      <p>
      Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all
      major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,
      distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated
      system without any undue pressure—a documented success for
      the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system
      evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at
      the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak
      codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform
      and the underlying GIT versioning software used to develop and
      distribute the system.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Extensive studies have shown that thanks to thesee features, users
      consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this
      wide-spread user demand, the present version remains   free of cost 
      as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as
      previous releases.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of
      eyes-free Assistance and social interaction and carries forward the
      well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user interface
      features that eventually show up in luser environments.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a crash-prone
      but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion "Emacs is a
      system from
      the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak evinced surprise at the
      unusual
      candor manifest in the assertion that it would take popular
      idiot-proven interfaces until the year 2070 to catch up to where the
      Emacspeak audio desktop is today. Industry experts welcomed this
      refreshing breath of Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time
      when users are reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD)
      unleashed by complex software systems backed by even more convoluted
      press releases.

      Test Results:</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
      <p>
      Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and
      not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without
      adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer. These
      same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped
      functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of
      Emacspeak once pointed out that thesee results re-emphasize the
      user-centric design of Emacspeak; “It is the user &#x2014; and
      not the
      computer&#x2013; that stops functioning when Emacspeak is
      uninstalled!”.

      href="https://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2021/09/snarfing-string-within-delimiters-with.html">previous article</a> detailed the implementation of a simple function
      that lets you snarf the contents within a pair of delimiters. That

      point was not on one of the pre-defined delimiters.

      and shows an implementation that attempts to strike a good balance.

      <li>We could generalize further by entirely dropping the

      I found that  I frequently needed to snarf a string enclosed within

      bolded, italics and other styled text in org-mode etc. I first tried

      wanted. However looking into it further revealed that emacs had all

      <p>
      Context switching in an Emacs workflow comes down to switching
      buffers &#x2014; and  Emacs provides a large number of
      built-ins and extensions packages for <i>switching
      buffers</i>. One can
      put together numerous workflows by picking among thesee to make
      context switching <i>contextual</i> &#x2014; using
      the most appropriate
      workflow can lead to  being able to focus much better on the core
      task of creating, editing, reviewing and publishing all forms of
      content ranging from research papers and presentations to Open
      Source Software.

      implemented in Emacspeak to fill the gaps.  See the related article

      <p>
      Emacs has a large number of facilities that lend themselves to
      multiple workflows. Investing some time in putting together
      workflows that suit one's needs has a large pay-back over time.

      class="section-number-2">5</span> Establishing
      Liberty, Equality And Freedom:</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
      <p>
      Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all
      major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,
      distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated
      system without any undue pressure—a documented success for
      the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system
      evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at
      the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak
      codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform
      and the underlying GIT versioning software used to develop and
      distribute the system.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Extensive studies have shown that thanks to thesee features, users
      consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this
      wide-spread user demand, the present version remains   priceless
      as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as
      previous releases.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of
      eyes-free Assistance and social interaction and carries forward the
      well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user interface
      features that eventually show up in luser environments.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a crash-prone
      but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion "Emacs is a
      system from
      the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak evinced surprise at the
      unusual
      candor manifest in the assertion that it would take popular
      idiot-proven interfaces until the year 2070 to catch up to where the
      Emacspeak audio desktop is today. Industry experts welcomed this
      refreshing breath of Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time
      when users are reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD)
      unleashed by complex software systems backed by even more convoluted
      press releases.

      Test Results:</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
      <p>
      Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and
      not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without
      adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer. These
      same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped
      functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of
      Emacspeak once pointed out that thesee results re-emphasize the
      user-centric design of Emacspeak; “It is the user &#x2014; and
      not the
      computer&#x2013; that stops functioning when Emacspeak is
      uninstalled!”.

      Liberty, Equality And Freedom:</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
      <p>
      Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all
      major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,
      distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated
      system without any undue pressure—a documented success for
      the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system
      evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at
      the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak
      codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform
      and the underlying GIT versioning software used to develop and
      distribute the system.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Extensive studies have shown that thanks to thesee features, users
      consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this
      wide-spread user demand, the present version remains   priceless
      as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as
      previous releases.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of
      eyes-free Assistance and social interaction and carries forward the
      well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user interface
      features that eventually show up in luser environments.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a crash-prone
      but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion "Emacs is a
      system from
      the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak evinced surprise at the
      unusual
      candor manifest in the assertion that it would take popular
      idiot-proven interfaces until the year 2070 to catch up to where the
      Emacspeak audio desktop is today. Industry experts welcomed this
      refreshing breath of Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time
      when users are reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD)
      unleashed by complex software systems backed by even more convoluted
      press releases.

      Test Results:</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
      <p>
      Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and
      not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without
      adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer. These
      same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped
      functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of
      Emacspeak once pointed out that thesee results re-emphasize the
      user-centric design of Emacspeak; “It is the user &#x2014; and
      not the
      computer&#x2013; that stops functioning when Emacspeak is
      uninstalled!”.

      named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant
      enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went
      further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98
      integrated Internetworking into all aspects of the audio desktop
      to provide the first fully interactive speech-enabled

      Summary</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
      <p>
      A few years ago, layout tables made speaking Web content difficult;
      that phase has now morphed into an even more horrifying soup of
      <code>div</code>
      and <code>span</code> tags styled by CSS. This also
      means that now, if you
      encounter a <code>table</code> element, it likely
      contains some useful data;
      also, deeply nested tables are beginning to feel like a thing of the
      past.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Sadly, this has not made getting data out of HTML tables any easier.
      A
      combination of badly created markup, many redundant DOM nodes that
      exist purely for enabling DOM scripting, and heavy-weight DOM
      structures that   result from  code-generation have mostly created
      a different, but equally appalling situation .
      </p>
      
      <p>
      One of the primary reasons to do everything in a rich end-user
      environment like Emacs is the ability to share data across tasks and
      being able to manipulate data as <i>data</i>, rather
      than working with that
      data's underlying visual representation. Emacs can now render
      Webdocuments that are content focused, so the next immediate desire
      is to
      be able to extract data in a useful form from EWW rendered pages.
      This
      article describes one simple approach that lets me turn HTML tables
      found in the willd into a coherent tabular data structure  that I can
      access meaningfully via emacspeak to obtain multiple <i>spoken
      views</i> of
      the data.

      Approach That Failed</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
      <p>
      I first tried to see if I could make EWW annotate the rendered
      <i>table
      data</i> with text properties &#x2014; sadly that proved
      impossible to do in
      the current implementation. Note however that Emacspeak does use
      textproperties to provide access to other aspects of HTML document
      structure such as section headers, and moving through the rendered
      tables in an EWW buffer.

      In the previous article entitled <a
      
      href="https://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2020/10/on-defining-keys-in-emacs.html">On Defining Keys In Emacs</a> I covered
      the issue of declaring key-sequences when defining keyboard
      short-cuts.  During the last week, I took the underlying Emacs Lisp
      function <code>edmacro-parse-key</code> and via a
      process of progressive
      simplification derived a new <code>new-kbd</code>
      function that is much simpler
      and consequently easier to understand.  You can see the step-by-step
      simplification via the Git history for file <a
      
      href="https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak/blob/master/lisp/new-kbd.el#L1">new-kbd.el</a> (note: used to
      be called <code>ems-kbd.el</code>).  That file contains
      the final version of the
      simplified function, along with a test-suite that verifies that
      it's
      behavior is convenient with the solution built into Emacs. The
      updated
      function is now part of Emacspeak and is named
      <code>ems-kbd</code> in that
      package.

      Function <code>edmacro-parse-keys</code>

      various parts of that string are processed in a single
      <code>while</code> loop.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      The first  step in simplification was to separate thesee steps, by 
      using function <code>split-string</code> to split the
      input string on
      <span class="underline">whitespace</span> to
      generate a list of words.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      A simple <code>cl-loop</code> is then used to turn each
      <code>word</code> into a <code>key</code>
      that
      is accumulated into a result vector.

      <p>
      Once tokenization is factored out, 
      the remainder of function
      <code>edmacro-parse-keys</code> 
      converts each key-specification into either the corresponding string
      or vector representation.

      The original requirement of parsing  the serialization of
      keyboard-macros brought along additional logic that I first
      eliminated, since my goal was to create a function to be used in
      defining keyboard-shortcuts.

      <ul class="org-ul">
      <li>I eliminated code that handled invocation of
      <code>M-x
      execute-extended-command</code> during a
      keyboard-macro.</li>

      keyboard-macro serialization.</li>

      Next, I rearranged conditionals and in that process eliminated
      <code>cond</code>
      clauses that were now effectively dead-code.

      <p>
      In the process, I also eliminated   test-predicates that had
      side-effects  to hopefully result in less fragile code.

      To improve readability, I created let-bindings to some of the regex
      patterns used to identify key-sequence patterns.
      In the process, I also made thesee more readable by using <span

      Since Emacs now takes a vector in every context  where a

      Overview</h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
      <p>
      Emacs is extremely flexible with respect to letting you bind keys to
      commands.
      Interestingly, and perhaps because of its history tracing back to
      <i>keyboard macros</i>,  <b>naming</b> the
      key you wish to bind is not so
      straight-forward as it appears on the surface. Here are things
      I've
      used and learnt over the last 30 years of Emacs hackery:
      </p>
      
      <ol class="org-ol">
      <li>The most basic way of naming a key is via a string of the
      form
      <i>\C-a</i> or <i>\M-\C-a</i> where
      <i>\C</i> denotes the <i>Control
      Modifier</i>.</li>
      <li>This notation gets unwieldy fast when using multiple
      modifiers as
      in the <i>\M-\C-a</i> example.</li>
      <li>It gets worse, under X, you can bind <i>\C- / for
      /Control Space</i>
      &#x2014; notice that the space character here which is easy to
      miss as
      white-space is significant.</li>
      <li>The <i>\&lt;modifier&gt;-char</i>
      notation mostly appears to date back to
      the age of the terminal emulator (tty), so for example, it cannot
      denote <i>Control+Right</i> for example.</li>
      <li>The Emacs and Elisp info manuals recommend using function
      <i>kbd</i>
      for this reason, this function on the surface provides a unified
      interface for naming keys.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
      If you look no further, you remain happy, but &#x2026;
      </p>

      <code>kbd</code></h2>
      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
      <p>
      But if you do peel the onion, here is what you  find:
      </p>
      <ol class="org-ol">
      <li>Function <code>kbd</code>  does nothing more
      than calling function
      <code>read-kbd-macro</code>.</li>
      <li>Function <code>read-kbd-macro</code> documents
      itself as <i>reading the region</i>
      as a  <i>keyboard macro</i>.</li>
      <li>The above overloading is  achieved  by the call to
      function <code>edmacro-parse-keys</code>.</li>
      <li>And finally we reach the scary core of the onion that is
      sufficient to make your eyes water!</li>
      <li>Function <code>edmacro-parse-keys</code> is an
      inscrutable piece of code
      that  both looks extremely clever and magical and like all clever
      code, feels fragile.</li>

      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
      <p>
      A simplified <code>ems-kbd</code> function that is free
      from the complexity
      resulting from reading in a saved keyboard macro feels like a
      worthwhile goal.
      I started down this road both to understand function
      <code>edmacro-parse-keys</code> &#x2014; sadly, I
      haven't yet found a specification
      for naming all available keys outside of the implementation of that
      function.
      So I started  <a
      
      
      href="https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak/blob/master/lisp/ems-kbd.el#L1">ems-kbd.el</a>

      goal of creating an equivalent <code>kbd</code>
      function.</p>

      Far</h3>
      <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
      <ol class="org-ol">
      <li>Documented the implementation.</li>
      <li>Added a simple set of tests in the file.</li>
      <li>Changed <span
      class="underline">if</span> to <span
      class="underline">cond</span> or <span
      class="underline">when</span> as
      appropriate.</li>
      <li>Eliminated the logic  that handled  the keyboard macro
      serialization for repeated keys.</li>
      <li>Removed the logic for handling invocations of
      <code>execute-extended-command</code> &#x2014;
      otherwise known as <span
      class="underline">M-x</span>.</li>
      <li>A lot more remains, e.g., 
      <ul class="org-ul">
      <li>simplifying how modifier bits are handled,</li>
      <li>Simplifying how special patterns like <span
      class="underline">SPC</span> or <span
      class="underline">TAB</span> are
      handled.</li>
      <li>And likely a lot more.</li>
      </ul></li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
      An alternative approach might be to rewrite it from scratch, but
      thatfeels intractable unless I can track down a specification for
      naming
      keys that is  exhaustive with respect to the various conventions
      thathave been used over the years.

      GMail is accessed from GNUS using the imap protocol.  The <span

      itself
      defines a slightly different and arguably easier to use set of
      search      operators. Module

      GMail's
      search operators; in practice, I have mostly only used the GMail
      Search operators in the last 8 years since implementing this module.

      spent
      time
      cleaning up and refactoring the results as described below. The
      end-result is to once again speed up Emacs startup, (about 25%
      faster      on my laptop)while making the setup cleaner and easier

      is a
      major win when running with a spinning-disk instead of an SSD. But
      the

      something in emacs got configured a given way &#x2014; AKA,
      there are

      <ol class="org-ol">
      <li>Remembering  the name of a custom-setting  you set up a

      <li>Command

      shouldn't publish,
      e.g., aPI keys and other private/personal bits.</li>

      written in 1987 in Fortran-77, and consisted of one single<br

      function. Though that style of programming would be frowned upon
      today<br />
      and is clearly not advisable for programming in the large,
      it's<br
      />
      interesting to observe that a more structured implementation as

      in this Rust implementation qrequires a lot more fore-thought

      simple game that I programmed in 1987 for the final class project

      CS-101 at IIT-Bombay. Here are the rules of the game:<br />

      rules for
      memory management, and learning to<br />
      use references  the Rust way were some of the things that were
      unique<br />
      to this learning experience.<br />
      Rust has some unique features including declaring lifetimes that
      are<br />
      typically needed in more advanced cases; however in my initial<br
      />attempts, not doing things the Rust way caused compile-time
      errors<br />
      that initially guided me toward using and declaring<br />
      lifetimes. Eventually, all of those declarations became
      unnecessary.<br />

      <ol class="org-ol"><li>If the number of sticks

      <li>At each turn, force the opponent toward the closest
      Fibonacci
      number.</li>
      <li>Do above while respecting the limit rule, i.e. if you pick

      Thoughts</h2><div class="outline-text-2"
      id="text-7"><ol
      class="org-ol"><li>The
      computing environment I now have is far more sophisticated<br
      />
      than what I had in 1987.</li>
      <li>Today, I have interactive completion, source-code<br
      />
      cross-references, on-the-fly access to documentation, and a
      fully<br
      />
      accessible book where I can look up things whenever I
      want.</li>
      <li>In 1987, I did most of my thinking and problem-solving in
      my<br />
      dorm-room with no computer to hand. When ready with the
      solution,<br
      />
      I made a few notes in Braille using a <a
      
      
      href="https://www.google.com/search?num=25&amp;lite=90586&amp;q=braille+pocket+slate">pocket-slate and stylus</a>,<br />
      then went to the computer room with a volunteer reader and
      typed<br
      />
      up the program, with the student volunteer providing
      high-quality<br
      />
      interactive spoken feedback.</li>
      <li>Interestingly, I think it took me less time  from memory
      to<br />
      implement the solution in 1987 &#x2014; perhaps this is time
      shrinking<br />
      with number of years passed.</li>
      <li>Either way, the primary take-away is that it pays to
      analyse
      a<br />
      problem before one actually starts writing code. Writing code
      is<br
      />
      always fun, and today, even more so given the excellent array
      of<br
      />
      tools &#x2014; but unless one focuses on the problem at hand,
      one      can<br />
      spend a lot of time <i>sharpening one's pencils</i>
      as
      opposed to<br />
      writing something useful.</li>

      Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all<br
      />
      major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,<br
      />      distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully
      integrated<br
      />system without any undue pressure—a documented success
      for<br
      />
      the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system<br
      />evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available
      at<br />
      the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the
      Emacspeak<br      />
      codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform<br
      />
      used to develop and distribute the software.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>Extensive studies have shown that thanks to thesee features,
      users<br />
      consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this<br
      />
      wide-spread user demand, the present version remains  
      priceless<br
      />
      as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as<br
      />
      previous releases.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the
      area
      of<br />
      eyes-free Assistance and social interaction and carries forward
      the<br
      />
      well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user
      interface<br />
      features that eventually show up in luser environments.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a
      crash-prone<br />
      but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion "Emacs is a
      system
      from<br />
      the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak evinced surprise at the
      unusual<br />
      candor manifest in the assertion that it would take popular<br
      />
      idiot-proven interfaces until the year 2070 to catch up to where
      the<br />
      Emacspeak audio desktop is today. Industry experts welcomed
      this<br
      />
      refreshing breath of Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a
      time<br
      />
      when users are reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt
      (FUD)<br
      />
      unleashed by complex software systems backed by even more
      convoluted<br />
      press releases.<br />

      These<br />

      of<br />
      Emacspeak once pointed out that thesee results re-emphasize the<br

      id="text-5"><p>Never
      a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all<br />
      major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,<br
      />      distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully
      integrated<br
      />system without any undue pressure—a documented success
      for<br
      />
      the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system<br
      />evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available
      at<br />
      the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the
      Emacspeak<br      />
      codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform<br
      />
      used to develop and distribute the software.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>Extensive studies have shown that thanks to thesee features,
      users<br />
      consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this<br
      />
      wide-spread user demand, the present version remains  
      priceless<br
      />
      as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as<br
      />
      previous releases.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the
      area
      of<br />
      eyes-free Assistance and social interaction and carries forward
      the<br
      />
      well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user
      interface<br />
      features that eventually show up in luser environments.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a
      crash-prone<br />
      but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion "Emacs is a
      system
      from<br />
      the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak evinced surprise at the
      unusual<br />
      candor manifest in the assertion that it would take popular<br
      />
      idiot-proven interfaces until the year 2070 to catch up to where
      the<br />
      Emacspeak audio desktop is today. Industry experts welcomed
      this<br
      />
      refreshing breath of Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a
      time<br
      />
      when users are reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt
      (FUD)<br
      />
      unleashed by complex software systems backed by even more
      convoluted<br />
      press releases.<br />

      These<br />
      same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user
      stopped<br
      />
      functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator
      of<br />
      Emacspeak once pointed out that thesee results re-emphasize the<br
      />user-centric design of Emacspeak; “It is the user

      href="https://saurabhkukade.github.io/Meta-programming-In-Python/">Meta Programming In Python</a> reminded me to write up<br />
      the equivalent for Emacs Lisp.<br />
      Decorators in Python enable you to modify the vehavior of
      existing<br
      />
      functions without changing the original function;
      <i>Advice</i> in Lisp<br />
      which traces back to the 80's enables similar functionality
      &#x2014;<br />
      incidentally, Advice was the inspiration behind Aspect
      Oriented<br      />

      Emacs      Lisp</h2><div class="outline-text-2"
      id="text-2"><p>Advice came to Emacs lisp in the
      summer
      of 1994, when module<br />
      <code>advice.el</code> shipped as part of Emacs 19.23. A
      few
      weeks later, a<br />
      colleague at work (Win Treese) wrote up a simple example that 
      added<br />
      a <span class="underline">before</span> 
      advice to
      the <span class="underline">vc-checkin</span>
      functions of the time to create <br />
      an <code>RCS</code> subdirectory if one did not exist. 
      This
      was such a neat<br />
      trick that all of us in our Lab adopted it &#x2014; and having
      random<br />
      RCS<sub>*</sub>,v* files lying around in the working
      directory became history.<br />
      </p></div></div><br />

      Advice
      &#x2014; Fall 1994</h2><div
      class="outline-text-2"
      id="text-3"><p>And then I decided to make Emacs 
      speak
      to me.<br />
      Module <code>advice.el</code> provided the ability to
      add      <span
      class="underline">before</span>, <span
      class="underline">after</span>, or<br />
      <span class="underline">around</span> advice.
      In
      brief, Emacspeak used thesee three classes of<br />
      advice as follows:<br />
      </p><br />
      <ol class="org-ol"><li>Speak line moved to
      after
      <code>next-line</code> and
      <code>previous-line</code> &#x2014; add<br />
      an <span class="underline">after</span> advice
      that
      called function
      <code>emacspeak-speak-line</code>.</li>
      <li>Speak character being deleted &#x2014; Add a <span
      class="underline">before</span> advice that<br
      />speaks the character under point before it is
      deleted.</li>
      <li>Get various types of completion spoken &#x2014; Add an
      <span class="underline">around</span>
      advice<br
      />
      that remembers the current context, calls the original
      function<br      />
      being advised, and finally speak the current context that now<br
      />
      reflects the completion.</li>
      </ol><br />

      arguably
      simplified front-end<br />
      implemented by module <code>nadvice.el</code> that
      enables

      Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all<br
      />
      major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,<br
      />      distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully
      integrated<br
      />system without any undue pressure—a documented success
      for<br
      />
      the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system<br
      />evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available
      at<br />
      the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the
      Emacspeak<br      />
      codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform<br
      />
      used to develop and distribute the software.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>Extensive studies have shown that thanks to thesee features,
      users<br />
      consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this<br
      />
      wide-spread user demand, the present version remains  
      priceless<br
      />
      as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as<br
      />
      previous releases.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the
      area
      of<br />
      eyes-free Assistance and social interaction and carries forward
      the<br
      />
      well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user
      interface<br />
      features that eventually show up in luser environments.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a
      crash-prone<br />
      but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion "Emacs is a
      system
      from<br />
      the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak evinced surprise at the
      unusual<br />
      candor manifest in the assertion that it would take popular<br
      />
      idiot-proven interfaces until the year 2070 to catch up to where
      the<br />
      Emacspeak audio desktop is today. Industry experts welcomed
      this<br
      />
      refreshing breath of Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a
      time<br
      />
      when users are reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt
      (FUD)<br
      />
      unleashed by complex software systems backed by even more
      convoluted<br />
      press releases.<br />

      These<br />
      same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user

      functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator
      of<br />
      Emacspeak once pointed out that thesee results re-emphasize the<br

      Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all<br
      />
      major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,<br
      />      distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully
      integrated<br
      />system without any undue pressure—a documented success
      for<br
      />
      the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system<br
      />evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available
      at<br />
      the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the
      Emacspeak<br      />
      codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform<br
      />
      used to develop and distribute the software.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>Extensive studies have shown that thanks to thesee features,
      users<br />
      consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this<br
      />
      wide-spread user demand, the present version remains  
      priceless<br
      />
      as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as<br
      />
      previous releases.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the
      area
      of<br />
      eyes-free Assistance and social interaction and carries forward
      the<br
      />
      well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user
      interface<br />
      features that eventually show up in luser environments.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a
      crash-prone<br />
      but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion "Emacs is a
      system
      from<br />
      the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak evinced surprise at the
      unusual<br />
      candor manifest in the assertion that it would take popular<br
      />
      idiot-proven interfaces until the year 2070 to catch up to where
      the<br />
      Emacspeak audio desktop is today. Industry experts welcomed
      this<br
      />
      refreshing breath of Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a
      time<br
      />
      when users are reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt
      (FUD)<br
      />
      unleashed by complex software systems backed by even more
      convoluted<br />
      press releases.<br />

      that unlike some modern (and<br />
      not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled
      without<br />
      adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer.
      These<br />
      same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user
      stopped<br
      />
      functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator
      of<br />
      Emacspeak once pointed out that thesee results re-emphasize the<br
      />user-centric design of Emacspeak; “It is the user
      &#x2014; and
      not the<br />
      computer&#x2013; that stops functioning when Emacspeak is

      id="text-1"><p>Emacs 26 has threads for executing
      functions asynchronously. Emacs<br />
      commands that call an external process and wait for that process
      to<br
      />
      finish make a good candidate for asynchronous execution &#x2014;
      e.g.,<br />
      <code>smtpmail-send-it</code> for sending mail. The
      arrival
      of threads provides<br />
      an interesting option for running such commands
      asynchronously.<br      />

      id="text-2"><p>I initially wrote a custom command
      for
      launching <code>gnus</code> asynchronously<br />
      &#x2014; it was a one-line  function that   ran the

      </p><div class="org-src-container"><pre
      class="src src-emacs-lisp">(make-thread #'gnus)

      <p>The above worked well &#x2014; except when command
      <code>gnus</code> needed user input<br />
      &#x2014; so I just had to be thoughtful about when I called it.
      But a
      few<br />
      weeks later, I wanted the equivalent for function
      <code>smtpmail-send-it</code><br />
      for  sending mail. I almost wrote myself one more command
      before<br

      stepping back to create a more generic solution.<br />

      fetch news/mail asynchronously. <br />

      <p>Similarly, when sending mail using
      <code>smtpmail</code> I can press <code>C-' a

      C-c</code> in the <code>*mail*</code> buffer to
      send
      mail without Emacs blocking.<br />

      one needs to make sure that the command being executed
      asynchronously<br />
      will not require user input. In the case of package
      <code>async</code>, the<br />
      asynchronous Emacs will block waiting for input; in the case

      <code>make-thread</code>, Emacs enters a blocking loop

      id="text-1"><p>Emacs has always provided a wealth
      of
      techniques for rapid keyboard<br />
      input (abbrev, dabbrev, hippie-expandand completion come to
      mind)<br
      />
      alongside a rich collection of tools for navigating among open<br
      />buffers. And thesee affordances have significantly increased
      over      the<br />
      last few years with the arrival of packages like
      <code>ido</code>,
      <code>company</code>,<br      />
      <code>helm</code> etc., each replete with different
      strategies for rapid task<br />
      completion such as flex and fuzzy matching. This article
      investigates<br />
      thesee tools in an eyes-free environment, specifically in the
      context<br />
      of Emacspeak and rapid task completion. I've not investigated
      every<br />

      a
      collection<br />
      of packages and techniques that have worked well in an

      context. Finally, the ultimate metric I use in each case is the
      time<br />
      to successful task completion &#x2014; since at the end of the
      day,
      that's<br />

      Terminology</h2><div class="outline-text-2"
      id="text-2"><p>For this article, I will use terms
      <i>suggestion</i> and <i>completion</i>
      to<br
      />
      mean  subtly different concepts. I'll also use terms
      <i>explore</i> and<br />
      <i>filter</i> in describing various phases in user
      interaction.<br />
      </p><br />
      <dl class="org-dl"><dt>Suggestion</dt>
      <dd>Offer the user some <i>suggestions</i> that
      help
      explore the space of choices. (metaphor: avoid the blank sheet of
      paper
      syndrome).</dd>
      <dt>Completion </dt>
      <dd>Filter the available choices based on user input with the
      goal
      of reaching the target as rapidly as possible.</dd>
      <dt>Explore </dt>
      <dd>User does not necessarily know what he is looking for, but
      expects to be able to <i>recognize</i> what he wants
      from the
      displayed choices.</dd>
      <dt>Target </dt>
      <dd>User knows exactly what he wants, e.g., filename, or
      function-name, but would still like to get there with the fewest
      possible
      number of keystrokes, along with the needed memory aids to guide the
      decision.</dd> </dl><br />
      <br />
      <p>Note that in practice, <i>suggestions</i> and
      <i>completions</i> work<br />
      hand-in-hand, with the visual display playing a central role
      in<br      />
      guiding the user through the pace of available choices. In a
      typical<br />
      user interaction session, the space of suggestions gets filtered
      by<br
      />
      user input to produce the available completions (choices) for the
      next<br />
      round of user input &#x2014; think of this as a<br />
      <b>Suggest/Input/Filter/Target</b> (SIFT)  interaction
      loop.
      Similarly, <i>explore</i> and<br />
      <i>target</i> type activities typically go hand-in-hand,
      with
      <i>explore</i><br />
      serving as a memory-aid for locating the

      all the help that Emacs can provide in completing the task as
      rapidly<br />
      as possible:<br />
      </p><br />
      <dl class="org-dl"><dt>File Navigation
      </dt>
      <dd>Navigating to and opening a file  &#x2014; either code
      or
      prose.</dd>
      <dt>Content Navigation</dt>
      <dd>Jump  to a specific location (section, function,
      class/method,
      or pattern-match) in  that file.</dd>
      <dt>Buffer Navigation</dt>
      <dd>Jump to an already open buffer in  a long-running
      Emacs.</dd> </dl><p>If that buffer existed
      &#x2014;
      but has since been killed (by<br />
      <code>midnight</code> for example), then re-open that
      buffer.<br />
      I do <b>everything</b> in Emacs, so open buffers include
       a
      large<br />
      number of ORG and LaTeX documents,  Web Pages opened in  EWW <br
      />
      (news sites, documentation, blog articles), IM Chats (I use<br
      />
      <code>jabber</code>), Mail  Buffers &#x2014; both
      open
      folders and previously<br />
      sent messages,  and much, much more.<br />
      </p><dl
      class="org-dl"><dt>Media</dt>
      <dd>Easily launch media streams including local and streaming
      media.</dd>
      <dt>EBooks</dt>
      <dd>Open (or jump to an already open) EBook to continue

      applies
      here as well.</dd> </dl><br />
      <br />
      <p>Notice that as one performs all of thesee tasks,
      <b>every

      Emacs buffer or Emacs buffer location. In the case of completion,

      Eyes-Free Interaction</h2><div
      class="outline-text-2"
      id="text-4"><p>Using spoken output &#x2014;
      as      opposed to a rich visual display &#x2014;  has<br
      />
      the following special features and/or drawbacks:<br />
      </p><br />
      <ol class="org-ol"><li>A large visual display
      can
      offer the user many choices at a time,<br />
      and the eye's ability to rapidly scan thesee choices makes for
      an<br />
      extremely fast <b>Suggest/Input/Filter/Target</b> loop.
      As an
      example, an<br />
      interface like <code>helm</code> can display a large
      number
      of initial<br />
      choices, with the user  filtering thesee down with a few strategic
      key-presses.</li>
      <li>Spoken output takes time &#x2014; and there is simply
      no
      way around<br />
      this &#x2014; speeding up speech-rate helps to a point, but
      speaking<br />
      50 choices very fast does not help the user  in the
      <i>explore</i><br />
      phase. This means that  effective filtering and ranking of the
      available<br />
      choices takes on added importance.</li>
      <li>More importantly, picking a
      <b>Suggest/Input/Filter/Target</b> (SIFT)<br />
      interaction loop that depends on a large display is
      sub-optimal<br      />
      for eyes-free interaction.</li>
      <li>Given (2,3), smart filtering, flex/fuzzy matching, and
      ranking<br />
      based on past user behavior take on added importance in an<br
      />
      eyes-free environment. As an aside, I have high hopes in this<br
      />
      area for package <code>prescient</code> &#x2014;
      though
      in my few days of usage,<br />
      it has yet to  make a  difference in my productivity.</li>
      <li>For many of the tasks enumerated in the previous section,
      (2,
      3<br />
      and 4) make <code>ido</code> with flex and fuzzy
      matching      extremely<br />
      effective. In contrast, <code>helm</code> with similar
      flex
      and fuzzy<br />
      matching (via packages <code>helm-flx</code> and
      <code>helm-fuzzier</code>) adds little<br />
      extra benefit &#x2014; and the fractional extra time to compute
      and<br />
      display the choices can even lead to a minor productivity
      hit.</li>
      <li>When it comes to writing code with completion, package
      <code>company</code><br />
      has proven extremely effective. Notice that when writing code,<br
      />one rarely if ever resorts to <b>fuzzy</b> matching
      &#x2014; this may well<br />
      be  subjective. Speaking for myself, I cannot think of
      function<br      />
      or method names in the context of fuzzy matching &#x2014;
      said<br
      />
      differently, it's hard to think <code>xl</code> for
      function-name<br />
      <code>next-line</code> &#x2014; even though in a
      given
      filtering context, <code>xl</code><br />
      might define the shortest path through the available choices
      to<br      />
      the target <code>next-line</code>. Given this, emacspeak
      implements a<br />
      <code>company front-end</code> that allows the user to
      navigate through the<br />
      available choices with succinct spoken feedback, and I use
      those<br
      />
      choices only after I have  typed sufficiently many characters
      to<br
      />
      have a manageable number of choices &#x2014; said differently,
      though<br />
      package <code>company</code> is set up to trigger after
      3      characters have<br />
      been typed, I usually end up typing more &#x2014; and  often
      resort
      to<br />
      <code>dabbrev</code> or
      <code>hippee-expand</code> to  input this longer
      prefix.</li>
      <li>Some of the shortcomings  with eyes-free interaction
      enumerated<br />
      above lead to my looking for effective work-arounds  that 
      might<br
      />
      well work well outside the eyes-free context, e.g. when the<br
      />
      available choices are too large to fit on a typical visual<br
      />
      display. Interestingly, most of thesee have also been solved by<br
      />mainstream Emacs developers in their never-ending/unerring
      quest for
      increased<br />
      productivity &#x2014; package <code>ido</code> and
      <code>company</code> are excellent exemplars.</li>

      <code>ido</code> with add-ons
      <code>flx-ido</code> and 
      <code>ido-completing-read+</code><br />
      (formerly <code>ido-ubiquitous</code>) as my
      primary/only      solution for this<br />
      task. I've dabbled with package <code>helm</code>
      &#x2014; primarily via command<br />
      <code>helm-mini</code> but have found almost no
      use-cases      where I did better with<br />
      <code>helm</code>. I also use command
      <code>org-switchb</code> to quickly jump to any of
      my<br

      open <code>org</code> buffers &#x2013; since that
      automatically filters the choices<br />
      down for me &#x2014; I can then get to the
      <code>org-mode</code> buffer I want with<br />
      one or two keystrokes. Notice that in  all of thesee cases, I'm
      relying<br />
      on the fact that I mostly know what I want, i.e., the
      <i>explore</i> phase<br />
      does not start with an entirely blank sheet of paper.<br />

      id="text-4-2"><p>Incremental search is your
      biggest
      and most effective friend in<br />
      effective eyes-free interaction &#x2014; this simply cannot be
      stressed<br />
      enough. That <b>everything</b> in Emacs is
      <i>searchable</i> via<br />
      incremental-search is a big win for eyes-free interaction. When
      you<br
      />
      have a large visual display, the human eye is the search interface
      of<br />
      first resort &#x2013; you typically use a
      <i>search-command</i> only if the<br />
      target is <i>below the fold</i> or far away from the
      cursor.
      Because spoken<br />
      output takes time, I use <i>isearch</i> even when the
      target
      is one or two<br />
      lines away.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>Structured navigation comes next in my toolbox for
      navigating
      content<br />
      &#x2014; <code>imenu</code> for code, and section
      navigation for documents (org,<br />
      LaTeX). I also use command <code>occur</code> to
      advantage
      since that provides a<br />
      quick way of finding all the desired targets in a document. Given
      that<br />
      program source-code uses indentation for displaying structure,<br
      />hbuilt-in command <code>selective-display</code>
      remains
      one of Emacs' hidden<br />
      treasures with respect to expanding/collapsing source-code.<br
      />
      </p><br />
      <p>Finally, I<br />
      use a combination of <code>isearch</code> and
      <code>structured navigation</code> in<br />
      <code>org-mode</code> buffres by collapsing the
      document, and
      then using<br />
      <code>isearch</code> to reveal the desired content
      fragment.<br />
      In the case of <code>LaTeX</code> documents, I use 
      package
      <code>reftex</code> to<br />
      generate a <i>navigation</i> buffer that functions as an
      interactive table<br />
      of contents. <br />

      but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion "Emacs is a
      system
      from<br />
      the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak evinced surprise at the
      unusual<br />
      candor manifest in the assertion that it would take popular<br
      />
      idiot-proven interfaces until the year 2070 to catch up to where
      the<br />
      Emacspeak audio desktop is today. Industry experts welcomed
      this<br

      refreshing breath of Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a

      Summary</h2><div class="outline-text-2"
      id="text-1"><p>I recently updated to a new Linux
      laptop running the latest Debian<br />
      (Rodete).  The upgrade went smoothly, but when I started using
      the<br
      />
      machine, I found that the Emacspeak TTS server for Voxin
      (Outloud)<br
      />
      crashed consistently; here, consistently equated to crashing on
      short<br />
      utterances which made typing or navigating by character an
      extremely<br />
      frustrating experience.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>I fixed the issue by creating a work-around in the TTS
      server

      Crashing</h2><div class="outline-text-2"
      id="text-2"><p>I use a DMIX plugin as the default

      href="https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak/blob/master/servers/linux-outloud/asoundrc">asoundrc</a>. With this configuration, writing to the ALSA device  was<br />
      raising an <span

      &#x2014; normally this error indicates a buffer<br />
      underrun &#x2014; that's when ALSA is starved of audio data.
       
      But in many<br />
      of thesee cases, the ALSA device was still in a <span
      class="underline">RUNNING</span> rather
      than<br      />
      an <span class="underline">XRUN</span> state
      &#x2014; this caused the Emacspeak server to<br />
      abort. Curiously, this happened only sporadically &#x2014; and
      from
      my<br />
      experimentation only happened when there were multiple streams
      of<br
      />
      audio active on the machine.<br />
      A few Google searches showed threads on the alsa/kernel devel
      lists<br
      />
      that indicated that this bug was present  in the case of DMIX
      devices<br />
      &#x2014; it was hard to tell if the patch that was submitted on
      the<br />
      alsa-devel list had made it into my installation of Debian.<br

      a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all<br />
      major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,<br
      />      distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully
      integrated<br
      />system without any undue pressure—a documented success
      for<br
      />
      the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system<br
      />evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available
      at<br />
      the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the
      Emacspeak<br      />
      codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform<br
      />
      used to develop and distribute the software.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>Extensive studies have shown that thanks to thesee features,
      users<br />
      consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this<br
      />
      wide-spread user demand, the present version remains  
      priceless<br

      as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as<br
      />
      previous releases.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the
      area
      of<br />
      eyes-free Assistance and social interaction and carries forward
      the<br
      />
      well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user
      interface<br />
      features that eventually show up in luser environments.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a
      crash-prone<br />
      but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion "Emacs is a
      system
      from<br />
      the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak evinced surprise at the
      unusual<br />
      candor manifest in the assertion that it would take popular<br
      />
      idiot-proven interfaces until the year 2070 to catch up to where
      the<br />
      Emacspeak audio desktop is today. Industry experts welcomed
      this<br
      />
      refreshing breath of Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a
      time<br
      />
      when users are reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt
      (FUD)<br
      />
      unleashed by complex software systems backed by even more
      convoluted<br />
      press releases.<br />

      of<br />
      Emacspeak once pointed out that thesee results re-emphasize the<br

      <p>With the above, my emacs (Emacs 26 built from Git) startup
      time
      is on<br />
      average 4 seconds.  This includes starting up emacspeak
      (including<br
      />
      speech servers), as well as launching a number of
      project-specific<br
      />
      shell buffers.  Given that I rarely restart Emacs, the startup time
      is<br />
      academic &#x2014; but speeding up Emacs startup did get me to
      clean-up my<br />
      Emacs setup.<br />

      years, and my <a

      <ol class="org-ol"><li>The init file defines a
      <code>start-up-emacs</code> function that does the<br
      />bulk of the work.</li>
      <li>Package-specific configuration is split up into<br
      />     
      <code>&lt;package&gt;-prepare.el</code>
      files.</li>
      <li>All of thesee files are byte-compiled.</li>
      </ol><br />
      <p>As a first step, I added code to my start-up file to time
      the
      loading<br />
      of various modules.<br />
      </p></div></div><br />

      the<br />
      above &#x2014; this is something that goes back to my time as
      a<br
      />
      grad-student at Cornell (when GitHub of course did not exist).<br
      />That is also when I originally learnt the trick of temporarily
      setting<br />
      <span

      8MB &#x2014; Emacs' default is 800K.<br />

      directly load packages &#x2014; it just made it easier to
      do<br
      />
      package-specific setup at the time.  As part of the cleanup, I
      updated<br />
      thesee to strictly load package-autoload files and wrapped
      post-package<br />
      setup code in <code>eval-after-load</code> &#x2014;
      this
      is effectively the same as<br />
      using <code>use-package</code>.<br />

      id="text-6"><p>Emacs has an extremely flexible
      mechanism for loading files &#x2014; this<br />
      means you can load compressed, encrypted or remote files
      without<br
      />
      having to worry about it. That flexibility comes at a cost
      &#x2014;
      if you<br />
      are sure you dont need this flexibility during start-up, then
      locally<br />
      binding <code>file-name-handler-alist</code> to
      <code>nil</code> is a big win &#x2014; in my<br

      <code>calendar-latitude</code> and

      geocoding my address &#x2014; geocoding is done by calling the
      Google
      Maps<br />
      API.  The geocoding API is plenty fast that you normally dont
      notice<br />
      it &#x2014; but it was adding anywhere from 1&#x2013;3
      seconds
      during<br />
      startup. Since my address doesn't change that often, I updated
      module<br />

      Summary</h2><div class="outline-text-2"
      id="text-1"><p>Module
      <i>json-read</i>      consumes JSON data structures and
      transforms them<br />
      into their elisp equivalent, where JSON dictionaries become alists
      and<br />
      JSON arrays become vectors. Accessing that data from lisp
      would<br      />
      ordinarily require using lisp accessors such as <span
      class="underline">assoc</span>, <span
      class="underline">car</span> and<br />
      <span class="underline">cdr</span>. With
      <i>let-alist</i>, we get data-binding for free
      &#x2014;
      the result<br />
      is elisp code that uses dotted-variables to directly access
      specific<br />
      slots in a deeply nested data structure. Thus, processing data<br
      />available as JSON via Web APIs is a really good use-case
      for<br
      />
      <i>let-alist</i>. Long-standing wish &#x2014; I wish
      Emacs' JSON parsing were<br />
      implemented in native code rather than in elisp.<br />

      the NOAA Weather Forecast (weekly and hourly) as JSON objects,

      the Google Maps API.</li>
      <li>The weather forecast display will leverage <span
      class="underline">org-mode</span> for<br />
      structured navigation; however we dont want that buffer to be<br
      />
      editable in general; moreover <span
      class="underline">special-mode</span> gives us
      nice<br />
      features  such as <span
      class="underline">q</span>
      for quitting that window. So we use<br />
      <span class="underline">special-mode</span> as
      the
      major mode, and <span
      class="underline">orgstruct-mode</span> as a
      minor<br />
      mode to get the best of both worlds.</li>
      <li>The API call to NOAA results in a JSON data structure
      where<br />
      <span
      
      class="underline">result.properties.periods</span>      holds an array of forecast<br />
      objects. Using that result in <i>let-alist</i> gives us
      data
      binding<br />
      for free! Notice the following:<br />
      <ol class="org-ol"><li>We can  use <span
      class="underline">.properties.periods</span> in
      the
      <span class="underline">cl-loop</span> as the
      list<br />
      to iterate over.</li>
      <li>Within that loop body, a second
      <i>let-list</i> 
      enables data<br />
      binding over the forecast object that we are processing in the<br
      />loop body.</li>
      <li>Data accesses inside the loop body are again simple given
      the<br />
      data binding created by the <i>let-alist</i>.</li>
      </ol></li>
      </ol><br />
      <p>The code for generating the hourly forecast is similar in
      spirit
      &#x2014;<br />
      the main take-away here is that <i>let-alist</i> saves a
      lot
      of<br />
      boiler-plate code that would have been otherwise required to
      take<br
      />
      apart the nested list structure we got back with our data.<br

      Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all<br
      />
      major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,<br
      />      distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully
      integrated<br
      />system without any undue pressure—a documented success
      for<br
      />
      the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system<br
      />evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available
      at<br />
      the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the
      Emacspeak<br      />
      codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform<br
      />
      used to develop and distribute the software.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>Extensive studies have shown that thanks to thesee features,
      users<br />
      consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this<br
      />
      wide-spread user demand, the present version remains  
      priceless<br
      />
      as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as<br
      />
      previous releases.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the
      area
      of<br />
      eyes-free Assistance and social interaction and carries forward
      the<br
      />
      well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user
      interface<br />
      features that eventually show up in luser environments.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a
      crash-prone<br />
      but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion "Emacs is a
      system
      from<br />
      the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak evinced surprise at the
      unusual<br />
      candor manifest in the assertion that it would take popular<br
      />
      idiot-proven interfaces until the year 2070 to catch up to where
      the<br />
      Emacspeak audio desktop is today. Industry experts welcomed
      this<br
      />
      refreshing breath of Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a
      time<br
      />
      when users are reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt
      (FUD)<br
      />
      unleashed by complex software systems backed by even more
      convoluted<br />
      press releases.<br />

      These<br />

      of<br />
      Emacspeak once pointed out that thesee results re-emphasize the<br

      ways:<br />
      </p><br />
      <ul class="org-ul"><li>IMap via Emacs This is
      implemented well in GNUS, and poorly in<br />
      Emacs/VM. Note that Emacs is single-threaded, and fetching
      large<br
      />
      volumes of email via IMap is painful.</li>
      <li>Batch Retrieval: IMap Tools like <span
      class="underline">fetchmail</span>, <span
      class="underline">offlineimap</span> and friends
      that
      live<br />
      outside of Emacs can be used to batch-retrieve email in the<br
      />
      background. The retrieved mail gets delivered
      <i>locally</i>
      as in the past.</li>
      <li>Mail Filtering: UNIX <span
      class="underline">procmail</span> enables
      filtering of
      locally<br />
      delivered email into separate folders for automatically
      organizing<br

      incoming email.</li>

      typically invoked  via key-sequence  <span
      class="underline">C-x m</span><br />
      (command: <i>compose-mail</i>). Emacs email packages
      implement<br />
      specific versions of this command, e.g. <i>vm-mail</i>
      from
      package<br />
      <span class="underline">emacs/vm</span>,
      <i>message-mail</i> from the <span
      class="underline">message</span> package
      etc.</li>
      <li>Sending email: This is specific to the email provider
      being      used,<br />
      e.g., <i>GMail</i>. In the past, UNIX machines could
      talk      <i>SMTP</i> to<br />
      the Mail Gateway, but this has mostly disappeared over time.

      <li>Maildir:  A mail folder  is a directory, with<br />

      include separating out various email lists into their  respective

      that
      is my<br />
      preferred means of quickly finding email messages using<br />
      search. This is very fast since the search happens

      Background</h2><div class="outline-text-2"
      id="text-1"><p>Emacspeak uses advice as the means
      to
      speech-enable Emacs.<br />
      Emacspeak's <b>advice</b> forms  need to check if
      the      function being<br />
      speech-enabled is being called interactively &#x2014; otherwise
      one
      would<br />
      get a lot of chatter as thesee functions get called from within
      elisp<br />
      programs, e.g. functions like <span
      class="underline">forward-sexp</span> or <span
      class="underline">kill-sexp</span>, that
      play<br
      />
      the dual role of both an interactive command, as well as a
      convenient<br />
      elisp function.<br />
      </p><br />
      <br />
      <p>Until Emacs 24, the solution used was to write code   that
      did
      the<br />
      following check:<br />
      </p><br />
      <pre class="example">(when (interactive-p) ...
      </pre><br />
      <p>In Emacs-24, <span
      class="underline">interactive-p</span> was made
      obsolete and replaced with <br />
      </p><pre
      class="example">(called-interactively-p
      'interactive)
      </pre><br />
      <p>Emacspeak initially used the above form to perform the
      equivalent<br />
      check. However, around the same time, Emacs'
      <b>advice</b> implementation<br />
      went through some changes, and there was an attempt to replace<br
      /><b>advice.el</b> with
      <b>nadvice.el</b>.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>At the end of that round of changes, some problems emerged
      with
      the<br />
      new <span
      class="underline">called-interactively-p</span>
      implementation; specifically, calling<br />
      :called-interactively-p_ within <span
      class="underline">around</span> advice forms
      resulted
      in hard<br />
      to debug errors, including one case of infinite recursion 
      involving<br />
      library <b>smie.el</b> when invoked from within <span
      class="underline">ruby-mode</span>.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>After studying the problem in depth in 2014, I decided to
      create
      an<br />
      Emacspeak-specific implementation of the <span
      class="underline">is-interactive</span>
      check.<br
      />
      </p><br />
      <p>The resulting implementation has worked well for the last
      30      months;<br />
      this article is here mostly to document how it works, and the
      reason<br />
      for its existence. Note that Emacspeak uses this custom
      predicate<br
      />
      <b>only</b> within <span
      class="underline">advice</span> forms. Further,
      this
      predicate has been coded<br />
      to only work within <span
      class="underline">advice</span> forms created by
      <span class="underline">emacspeak</span>.
      This<br />
      constraint can likely be relaxed, but the tighter implementation
      is<br
      />
      less risky.<br />

      function call is the result of explicit user interaction, i.e.
      by<br
      />
      pressing a key, or via an explicit call to<br />
      <span
      class="underline">call-interactively</span>.
      Emacspeak produces auditory feedback only if<br />
      this predicate returns <span
      class="underline">t</span>.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>We first introduce a flag that will be used to record if
      the      enclosing<br />
      (containing) function has an Emacspeak-defined advice on it and
      is<br
      />
      called interactively &#x2014; thesee are the only cases that our
      predicate<br />
      needs to test.<br />
      </p><pre class="example">(defvar
      ems-called-interactively-p nil
      "Flag that records if containing function was called
      interactively."
      </pre><br />
      <p>Next, we define a function that checks if interactive calls
      to
      a<br />
      function should be recorded. We're only interested in functions
      that<br />
      have an <span class="underline">advice</span>
      form
      defined by Emacspeak &#x2014; all Emacspeak-defined<br />
      advice forms have the name <span
      class="underline">emacspeak</span>.<br />
      </p><br />
      <pre class="example">(defun ems-record-interactive-p
      (f)
      "Predicate to test if we need to record interactive calls of
      this function. Memoizes result for future use by placing a
      property 'emacspeak on the function symbol."
      (cond
      ((not (symbolp f)) nil)
      ((get f 'emacspeak) t) ; already memoized
      ((ad-find-some-advice f 'any  "emacspeak") ; there is
      an
      emacspeak advice
      (put f 'emacspeak t)) ; memoize for future and return true
      (t nil)))
      </pre><br />
      <p>This is a memoized function that remembers earlier
      invocations
      by<br />
      setting property <span
      class="underline">emacspeak</span> on the
      function      symbol.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>All <span
      class="underline">advice</span>
      forms created by Emacspeak are named <span
      class="underline">emacspeak</span>, so we<br
      />
      can test for the presence of such advice forms using the test:<br
      /></p><br />
      <pre class="example">(ad-find-some-advice f 'any
            "emacspeak")
      </pre><br />
      <p>If this test returns <span
      class="underline">T</span>, we memoize the result
      and
      return it.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>Next, we advice function <span
      class="underline">call-interactively</span> to
      check 
      <br />
      if the function being called interactively is one of the
      functions<br
      />
      that has been advised by Emacspeak. If so, we record the fact in 
      the<br />
      previously declared global flag <br />
      <span
      
      
      class="underline">ems-called-interactively-p</span>.<br />
      </p><br />
      <br />
      <pre class="example">(defadvice call-interactively
      (around emacspeak  pre act comp)
      "Set emacspeak  interactive flag if there is an Emacspeak
      advice 
      on the function being called."
      (let ((ems-called-interactively-p ems-called-interactively-p)) ;
      preserve
      enclosing state
      (when (ems-record-interactive-p (ad-get-arg 0))
      (setq ems-called-interactively-p (ad-get-arg 0)))
      ad-do-it))
      </pre><br />
      <p>We define an equivalent advice form on function<br />
      <span
      class="underline">funcall-interactively</span> as
      well. Now, whenever any function that has<br />
      been advised by Emacspeak is called interactively, that
      interactive<br
      />
      call gets recorded in the global flag. In the custom Emacspeak<br
      />predicate we define, we check the value of this flag, and
      if<br
      />
      set, consume it, i.e. unset the flag and return <span
      class="underline">T</span>.<br />
      </p><br />
      <pre class="example">(defsubst ems-interactive-p ()
      "Check our interactive flag.
      Return T if set and we are called from the advice for the current
      interactive command. Turn off the flag once used."
      (when ems-called-interactively-p                 ; interactive call
      (let ((caller (cl-second (backtrace-frame 1))) ; name of containing
      function
      (caller-advice  ;advice generated wrapper
      (ad-get-advice-info-field ems-called-interactively-p 
      'advicefunname))          (result nil))
      (setq result
      (or (eq caller caller-advice) ; called from our advice
      (eq ems-called-interactively-p caller))) ; called from advice
      wrapper      (when result
      (setq ems-called-interactively-p nil) ; turn off now that we used 
      it      result))))
      </pre><br />
      <p>The only fragile part of the above predicate is the call
      to<br />
      <span class="underline">backtrace-frame</span>
      which we use to discover the name of the enclosing<br />
      function. Notice however that this is no more fragile than the
      current<br />
      implementation of <span
      class="underline">called-interactively-p</span>
      &#x2014; which also uses<br />
      <span
      class="underline">backtrace-frame</span>; If
      there are changes in the byte-compiler, this<br />
      form may need to be updated. The implementation above has the<br
      />
      advantage of working correctly for Emacspeak's specific
      use-case.<br />

      paragraph:<br
      />
      </p><br />
      <pre class="example">I implemented package
      soundscape to
      create a platform that would let me experiment
      with different tools that aid in concentration. After using
      Soundscapes
      for about a week,
      I have also found that it reduces some of the fatigue that results
      from
      having to listen
      to synthetic text-to-speech for extended periods. The true value (if
      any)
      of this package
      will be a function of how heavily I find myself using it six months
      from
      now --- as a
      metric, complete success might mean that in mid-2016, I still have
      automatic soundscapes
      turned on.

      Soundscapes in Emacspeak. As<br />
      conjectured, it has definitely increased my productivity,
      specifically<br />
      in terms of staying focused on a given task at hand. Over the
      year,<br
      />
      I've also augmented the emacspeak Audio Desktop with support
      for<br />
      binaural audio — see module <code>sox-gen</code> —
      which
      provides a collection of<br />
      binaural themes for use during different times of the day.

      <a

      Emacspeak Soundscapes have been updated to take<br />
      advantage of Boodler's limited abilities in the areas of
      spatial<br />
      positioning. I typically use <code>Soundscapes</code>
      with
      one of several virtual<br />
      ALSA devices that have been configured to apply different
      Ladspa<br

      effects such as <i>reverb</i> or
      <i>crossfeed</i>
      depending on the ambient<br />
      environment where I am working &#x2014; this significantly

      id="text-4"><p>Never
      a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all<br />
      major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,<br
      />      distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully
      integrated<br
      />system without any undue pressure—a documented success
      for<br
      />
      the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system<br
      />evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available
      at<br />
      the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the
      Emacspeak<br      />
      codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform<br
      />
      used to develop and distribute the software.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>Extensive studies have shown that thanks to thesee features,
      users<br />
      consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this<br
      />
      wide-spread user demand, the present version remains  
      priceless<br
      />
      as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as<br
      />
      previous releases.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the
      area
      of<br />
      eyes-free social interaction and carries forward the<br />
      well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user<br
      />
      interface features that eventually show up in luser
      environments.<br
      />
      </p><br />
      <p>On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a
      crash-prone<br />
      but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion "Emacs is a
      system
      from<br />
      the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak evinced surprise at the
      unusual<br />
      candor manifest in the assertion that it would take popular<br
      />
      idiot-proven interfaces until the year 2070 to catch up to where
      the<br />
      Emacspeak audio desktop is today. Industry experts welcomed
      this<br
      />
      refreshing breath of Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a
      time<br
      />
      when users are reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt
      (FUD)<br
      />
      unleashed by complex software systems backed by even more
      convoluted<br />
      press releases.<br />

      These<br />
      same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user
      stopped<br

      functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator
      of<br />
      Emacspeak once pointed out that thesee results re-emphasize the<br

      <li>Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois) was released as
      OpenSource
      on<br />
      the Internet in May 1995 as the first complete speech
      interface<br      />
      to UNIX workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96
      (code<br
      />
      named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant<br
      />
      enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went<br
      />
      further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98<br />
      integrated Internetworking into all aspects of the audio
      desktop<br
      />
      to provide the first fully interactive speech-enabled
      WebTop.</li>

      Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all<br
      />
      major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,<br
      />      distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully
      integrated<br
      />system without any undue pressure—a documented success
      for<br
      />
      the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system<br
      />evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available
      at<br />
      the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the
      Emacspeak<br      />
      codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform<br
      />
      used to develop and distribute the software.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>Extensive studies have shown that thanks to thesee features,
      users<br />
      consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this<br
      />
      wide-spread user demand, the present version remains  
      priceless<br
      />
      as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as<br
      />
      previous releases.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the
      area
      of<br />
      eyes-free social interaction and carries forward the<br />
      well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user<br
      />
      interface features that eventually show up in luser
      environments.<br
      />
      </p><br />
      <p>On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a
      crash-prone<br />
      but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion "Emacs is a
      system
      from<br />
      the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak evinced surprise at the
      unusual<br />
      candor manifest in the assertion that it would take popular<br
      />
      idiot-proven interfaces until the year 2070 to catch up to where
      the<br />
      Emacspeak audio desktop is today. Industry experts welcomed
      this<br
      />
      refreshing breath of Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a
      time<br
      />
      when users are reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt
      (FUD)<br
      />
      unleashed by complex software systems backed by even more
      convoluted<br />
      press releases.<br />

      These<br />
      same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user
      stopped<br
      />
      functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator
      of<br />
      Emacspeak once pointed out that thesee results re-emphasize the<br
      />user-centric design of Emacspeak; "It is the user

      blind and visually impaired users.</li>
      <li>Emacspeak-10.0 &#x2013;(AKA<br />
      Emacspeak-2000) code named WonderDog&#x2013; continued the
      tradition
      of<br />
      award-winning software releases designed to make eyes-free computing
      a<br />
      productive and pleasurable experience.</li>
      <li>Emacspeak-9.0 &#x2013;(AKA<br />

      <li>Emacspeak-8.0 &#x2013;(AKA Emacspeak-98++) code named
      BlackDog&#x2013; was a major upgrade to<br />
      the speech output extension to Emacs.</li>
      <li>Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois) was released as
      OpenSource
      on<br />
      the Internet in May 1995 as the first complete speech
      interface<br      />
      to UNIX workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96
      (code<br
      />
      named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant<br
      />
      enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went<br
      />
      further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98<br />
      integrated Internetworking into all aspects of the audio
      desktop<br

      <p>You can experiment with installed Boodler agents using

      <code>soundscape</code> and
      <code>soundscape-stop</code>. You can enable and
      disable<br />
      <i>automatic soundscapes</i> using command
      <code>soundscape-toggle</code>. The<br />
      currently active default Soundscape theme can be inspected via
      command<br />
      <code>soundscape-display</code> &#x2014; this
      produces a

      <p>Package <code>soundscape.el</code> considers

      a consequence, two soundscapes (<i>LightWind</i> and

      let me experiment with different tools that aid in<br />
      concentration. After using Soundscapes for about a week, I have
      also<br />
      found that it reduces some of the fatigue that results from having
      to<br />
      listen to synthetic text-to-speech for extended  periods.<br
      />      The true value (if any) of this package will be a
      function of how
      heavily<br />
      I find myself using it six months from now &#x2014; as a metric,
      <i>complete<br />
      success</i>  might mean that in mid-2016, I still  have
      automatic<br />
      soundscapes turned on.<br />
      As I type this article in Emacs <span
      class="underline">org-mode</span>, I hear  the
      sound
      of<br />
      water-drops falling softly in the background, and I take note<br

      that I have not switched tasks  for the entire time I have
      spent<br
      />
      writing this article.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>Other success metrics &#x2014; harder to measure
      &#x2014; might include how<br />
      effective Soundscapes are in helping the user stay focused on
      a<br      />
      given activity for extended periods of time. In an
      ever-connected<br
      />
      world buzzing with a constant stream of distractions ranging
      from<br
      />
      incoming email and instant-messages to a flood of twitter
      updates,<br
      />
      this is likely the most relevant metric.<br />

      major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,<br
      />      distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully
      integrated<br
      />system without any undue pressure—a documented success
      for<br
      />
      the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system<br
      />evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available
      at<br />
      the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the
      Emacspeak<br      />
      codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform<br
      />
      used to develop and distribute the software.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>Extensive studies have shown that thanks to thesee features,
      users<br />
      consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this<br
      />
      wide-spread user demand, the present version remains  
      priceless<br
      />
      as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as<br
      />
      previous releases.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the
      area
      of<br />
      eyes-free social interaction and carries forward the<br />
      well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user<br
      />
      interface features that eventually show up in luser
      environments.<br
      />
      </p><br />
      <p>On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a
      crash-prone<br />
      but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion "Emacs is a
      system
      from<br />
      the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak evinced surprise at the
      unusual<br />
      candor manifest in the assertion that it would take popular<br
      />
      idiot-proven interfaces until the year 2070 to catch up to where
      the<br />
      Emacspeak audio desktop is today. Industry experts welcomed
      this<br
      />
      refreshing breath of Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a
      time<br
      />
      when users are reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt
      (FUD)<br
      />
      unleashed by complex software systems backed by even more
      convoluted<br />
      press releases.<br />

      without<br />

      These<br />
      same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user
      stopped<br

      functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator
      of<br />
      Emacspeak once pointed out that thesee results re-emphasize the<br

      Summary</h2><div class="outline-text-2"
      id="text-1"><p>Emacspeak now uses multiple
      text-to-speech streams &#x2014; as an example,<br />
      this enables spoken notifications that do not interrupt ongoing
      spoken<br />
      output. To make such notifications more perceivable, Emacspeak
      places<br />
      notifications to the right of the user by leveraging
      Linux-ALSA<br      />
      features that allow one to scale the amplitude of the left and
      right<br />
      audio channels.<br />
      </p></div></div><br />
      <div id="outline-container-orgheadline2"

      class="section-number-2">2</span>
      Background</h2><div class="outline-text-2"
      id="text-2"><p>Until now, Emacspeak has used a
      single
      instance of a Text-To-Speech<br />
      (TTS) engine to produce all spoken feedback. An unfortunate<br
      />
      consequence is that any spoken announcement necessarily
      interrupts<br
      />
      ongoing speech; as an example, an incoming instant-message
      (e.g.,<br
      />
      Jabber notification) can interrupt what you're currently<br
      />
      reading. <br />
      </p><br />
      <p>Emacs itself produces a large number of asynchronous
      messages<br />
      depending on the number of processes running within Emacs; at
      present,<br />
      all Emacs generated messages are <i>equal</i> though
      there
      are ongoing<br />
      plans to improve this situation going forward, e.g., using
      package<br
      />
      <code>alert</code>. With Emacspeak now able to use
      multiple
      TTS streams, arrival<br />
      of package <code>alert</code> within Emacs should
      facilitate
      smarter handling of<br />
      different categories of messages over time.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>Playing multiple TTS streams simultaneously can make it
      hard      to<br />
      understand the resulting output; Emacspeak leverages underlying
      ALSA<br />
      functionality to send notifications to a virtual ALSA device
      that<br
      />
      places the auditory output <i>mostly</i> on the right
      channel. See the<br />
      following paragraphs on setup/configuration. I'm presently using
      this<br />
      on Linux with the <code>linux-outloud</code> voice
      &#x2014; you need to have a copy of<br />
      this TTS engine installed and working &#x2014; see <a
      href="http://voxin.oralux.net/">Voxin</a> for

      obtaining that engine. Note: the Emacspeak
      <code>espeak</code> server does not<br />
      use raw ALSA for its output &#x2014; consequently, notifications
      produced<br />
      by  <code>espeak</code> play on both left and right
      channels,
      making it<br />
      impossible to understand. The <code>mac</code> server
      may be
      able to support<br />
      this functionality using something Mac-specific &#x2014; patches

      id="text-1"><p>Audio formatted output is provided
      via
      <code>voice-lock</code> in Emacspeak.<br />
      The feature was originally implemented in 1994 and 
      significantly<br
      />
      overhauled in 2002 (with no change in functionality). Now, in
      2015,<br
      />
      the implementation has been reworked to be once again simpler
      &#x2014; but<br />
      with the same functionality.<br />
      </p></div></div><br />
      <div id="outline-container-orgheadline2"
      class="outline-2"><h2
      id="orgheadline2"><span
      class="section-number-2">2</span> 1994: Original
      Implementation</h2><div class="outline-text-2"
      id="text-2"><p>Font-lock was a new feature in
      Emacs 19
      &#x2014; it was introduced right<br />
      around the time the Emacspeak project was started.<br />
      At the time, there  were multiple font-lock packages in<br />
      Emacs. Emacspeak implemented <code>voice-lock</code> via
      a
      stand-alone module<br />
      that attached property <code>personality</code> to
      buffer      contents. The<br />
      <code>dtk-speak</code> Text-To-Speech module treated
      strings
      annotated with<br />
      property <code>personality</code> as an <i>aural
      display list</i> when producing<br />
      spoken output.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>In  the winter of 1995, I implemented Aural CSS in
      emacspeak,
      and<br />
      this resulted in module <code>acss.el</code>
      &#x2014;      that module provides a clean<br />
      abstraction for defining <i>values</i> that can be
      assigned
      to property<br />
      <code>personality</code>. Next, the rest of emacspeak
      was      overhauled to<br />
      express all <code>voice-lock</code> features via the
      ACSS      abstraction.<br />
      </p></div></div><br />
      <div id="outline-container-orgheadline3"
      class="outline-2"><h2
      id="orgheadline3"><span
      class="section-number-2">3</span> 2002
      Overhaul</h2><div class="outline-text-2"
      id="text-3"><p>With feature
      <code>font-lock</code> now mature, Emacs itself
      converged on
      a<br />
      single font-lock module with <code>jit-lock.el</code>
      providing just-in-time font<br />
      locking. This meant that Emacspeak's
      <code>voice-lock</code> feature could now be<br />
      more easily implemented by attaching appropriate advice to
      lisp<br      />
      functions <code>put-text-property</code> and friends
      &#x2014; this led to the deletion<br />
      of module <code>voice-lock.el</code> and the creation of
      module<br />
      <code>emacspeak-personality.el</code>.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>That module provided multiple options for how faces were
      mapped
      to<br />
      personalities:<br />
      </p><br />
      <ul class="org-ul"><li>Cumulative where 
      property
      <code>personality</code> was either appended or<br
      />
      prepended to the list of personalities  at any given
      position.</li>
      <li>Simple: where the new personality directly replaced any
      previously<br />
      applied <code>personality</code> property.</li>
      <li>None: Where faces were not mapped to
      personalities.</li>
      </ul></div></div><br />

      class="outline-2"><h2

      class="section-number-2">4</span> 2015
      Overhaul</h2><div class="outline-text-2"
      id="text-4"><p>And now, in 2015, the code in
      module
      <code>dtk-speak.el</code> that implements<br />
      audio-formatting has been overhauled to directly map faces to<br
      />
      personalities.  This implementation can be enabled by setting
      the<br
      />
      option <code>emacspeak-personality-voiceify-faces</code>
      provided in module<br />
      <code>emacspeak-personality.el</code> to <span
      class="underline">All</span>.  This means that
      the      new<br />
      implementation can co-exist (at least for a while) with the
      earlier<br
      />
      advice-based implementation from module
      <code>emacspeak-personality.el</code>.<br />
      </p><br />
      <p>once deemed to be stable, the new implementation will
      become      the<br />
      default &#x2014; by changing the default value of<br />
      <code>emacspeak-personality-voiceify-faces</code> to
      <span

      Summary</h2><div class="outline-text-2"
      id="text-5"><p>From an end-user's
      perspective,      nothing has changed in 21 years. From<br />
      the perspective of implementing voice-lock for Emacs modules,
      nothing<br />
      has changed &#x2014; all that an Emacspeak extension for a
      specific
      package<br />
      needs to do to enable <code>voice-lock</code> is to set
      up a
      face-&gt;personality<br />
      mapping as before via function
      <code>voice-setup-add-map</code>. Note that<br />
      property <code>personality</code> will continue to have
      higher precedence than<br />
      property <code>face</code> with respect to the audio
      formatting that gets applied<br />
      i.e. Emacspeak first consults value of property
      <code>personality</code>, and if<br />
      that is not set, but there is a <code>face</code>
      property
      set, then that<br />
      face-&gt;personality mapping (if defined) is used as the aural
      style.<br />

      <li>StumpWM is set up to deny raise-focus requests
      &#x2014;      this is so that activity in a window doesn't

      <ol class="org-ol"><li>Emacspeak running in a
      window to provide a local audio desktop.</li>
      <li>ChromeVox running in a second window to provide access to

      Emacs' built-in EWW browser.</li>
      <li>SSH running in an XTerm to my remote Linux desktop  in a
      third
      window. The remote desktop runs Emacspeak and produces  auditory
      feedback
      through a local speech server.</li>

      <p>The setup described below is implemented via my personal
      <code>.XResources</code><br />

      <div id='text-1-4' class='outline-text-3'>
      <p>
      Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all
      major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,
      distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated
      system without any undue pressure—a documented success for
      the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system
      evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at
      the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak
      codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform
      used to develop and distribute the software.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Extensive studies have shown that thanks to thesee features, users
      consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this
      wide-spread user demand, the present version remains   priceless
      as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as
      previous releases.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of
      eyes-free social interaction and carries forward the
      well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user
      interface features that eventually show up in luser environments.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a crash-prone
      but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion "Emacs is a
      system
      from
      the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak evinced surprise at the
      unusual
      candor manifest in the assertion that it would take popular
      idiot-proven interfaces until the year 2070 to catch up to where the
      Emacspeak audio desktop is today. Industry experts welcomed this
      refreshing breath of Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time
      when users are reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD)
      unleashed by complex software systems backed by even more convoluted
      press releases.

      <p>
      Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and
      not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without
      adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer. These
      same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped
      functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of
      Emacspeak once pointed out that thesee results re-emphasize the
      user-centric design of Emacspeak; "It is the user –and not
      the      computer– that stops functioning when Emacspeak is
      uninstalled!".

      Emacspeak 42.0 while moving to GitHub from Google Code continues to
      innovate in the areas of auditory user interfaces and efficient,
      light-weight Internet access.  Emacspeak 41.0 continues to improve
      upon the desire to provide not just equal, but superior access —
      technology when correctly implemented can significantly enhance the
      human ability. Emacspeak 40.0 goes back to Web basics by enabling
      <a
      
      
      href='http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2013/11/reading-web-content-efficiently.html'>efficient access</a> to large amounts of readable Web content. Emacspeak
      39.0 continues the Emacspeak tradition of increasing the breadth of
      user tasks that are covered without introducing unnecessary
      bloatware. Emacspeak 38.0 is the latest in a series of award-winning
      releases from Emacspeak Inc. Emacspeak 37.0 continues the tradition
      of
      delivering robust software as reflected by its code-name. Emacspeak
      36.0 enhances the audio desktop with many new tools including full
      EPub support — hence the name EPubDog. Emacspeak 35.0 is all about
      teaching a new dog old tricks — and is aptly code-named HeadDog in
      honor of our new Press/Analyst contact. emacspeak-34.0 (AKA Bubbles)
      established a new beach-head with respect to rapid task completion
      in      an eyes-free environment. Emacspeak-33.0 AKA StarDog brings
      unparalleled cloud access to the audio desktop. Emacspeak 32.0 AKA
      LuckyDog continues to innovate via open technologies for better
      access. Emacspeak 31.0 AKA TweetDog — adds tweeting to the
      Emacspeak
      desktop. Emacspeak 30.0 AKA SocialDog brings the Social Web to the
      audio desktop—you can't but be social if you speak! Emacspeak
      29.0—AKAAbleDog—is a testament to the resilliance and innovation
      embodied by Open Source software—it would not exist without the
      thriving Emacs community that continues to ensure that Emacs remains
      one of the premier user environments despite perhaps also being one
      of
      the oldest. Emacspeak 28.0—AKA PuppyDog—exemplifies the rapid
      pace of
      development evinced by Open Source software. Emacspeak 27.0—AKA
      FastDog—is the latest in a sequence of upgrades that make previous
      releases obsolete and downgrades unnecessary. Emacspeak 26—AKA
      LeadDog—continues the tradition of introducing innovative access
      solutions that are unfettered by the constraints inherent in
      traditional adaptive technologies. Emacspeak 25 —AKA ActiveDog
      —re-activates open, unfettered access to online
      information. Emacspeak-Alive —AKA LiveDog —enlivens open,
      unfettered
      information access with a series of live updates that once again
      demonstrate the power and agility of open source software
      development. Emacspeak 23.0 – AKA Retriever—went the extra mile
      in
      fetching full access. Emacspeak 22.0 —AKA GuideDog —helps users
      navigate the Web more effectively than ever before. Emacspeak 21.0
      —AKA PlayDog —continued the Emacspeak tradition of relying on
      enhancedproductivity to liberate users. Emacspeak-20.0 —AKA
      LeapDog      —continues
      the long established GNU/Emacs tradition of integrated innovation to
      create a pleasurable computing environment for eyes-free
      interaction. emacspeak-19.0 –AKA WorkDog– is designed to enhance
      user productivity at work and leisure. Emacspeak-18.0 –code named
      GoodDog– continued the Emacspeak tradition of enhancing user
      productivity and thereby reducing total cost of
      ownership. Emacspeak-17.0 –code named HappyDog– enhances user
      productivity by exploiting today's evolving WWW
      standards. Emacspeak-16.0 –code named CleverDog– the follow-up
      to      SmartDog– continued the tradition of working better,
      faster,
      smarter. Emacspeak-15.0 –code named SmartDog–followed up on
      TopDog
      as the next in a continuing a series of award-winning audio desktop
      releases from Emacspeak Inc. Emacspeak-14.0 –code named
      TopDog–was
      the first release of this millennium. Emacspeak-13.0 –codenamed
      YellowLab– was the closing release of the
      20th. century. Emacspeak-12.0 –code named GoldenDog– began
      leveraging the evolving semantic WWW to provide task-oriented speech
      access to Webformation. Emacspeak-11.0 –code named Aster– went
      the
      final step in making Linux a zero-cost Internet access solution for
      blind and visually impaired users. Emacspeak-10.0 –(AKA
      Emacspeak-2000) code named WonderDog– continued the tradition of
      award-winning software releases designed to make eyes-free computing
      a
      productive and pleasurable experience. Emacspeak-9.0 –(AKA
      Emacspeak 99) code named BlackLab– continued to innovate in the
      areas
      of speech interaction and interactive accessibility. Emacspeak-8.0
      –(AKA Emacspeak-98++) code named BlackDog– was a major upgrade
      to      the speech output extension to Emacs.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois) was released as OpenSource on
      the Internet in May 1995 as the first complete speech interface
      to UNIX workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96 (code
      named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant
      enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went
      further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98
      integrated Internetworking into all aspects of the audio desktop
      to provide the first fully interactive speech-enabled WebTop.

      Server
      Output To Aid In TTS Server Development</h2>
      <div id='text-1' class='outline-text-2'>
      <p>
      This is mostly of interest to developers of Emacspeak speech
      servers.      This article outlines how one can log TTS server
      output to a file.
      The loggeds record all commands send by Emacspeak to the TTS server.
      It is best to generate the logs in an Emacs session that is separate
      from the Emacs session where you are developping your code.
      This keeps the logs short, and makes isolating problems much easier.

      Works</h3>
      <div id='text-1-1' class='outline-text-3'>
      <p>
      The <span
      class='underline'>emacspeak/servers</span>
      directory now contains <span
      
      class='underline'>log_&lt;tts-name&gt;</span>
      servers for the various supported speech servers.  When selected,
      thesee <i>log-speech</i> servers produce no speech
      output;      instead, they
      output the speech server commands received from Emacspeak to a file
      in
      <span class='underline'>/tmp</span> named
      <span
      class='underline'>tts-log-$$</span>.
      Once you're done logging, you can examine this file  from the
      primary
      Emacs session.

      Workflow</h3>
      <div id='text-1-2' class='outline-text-3'>
      <p>
      Assume you want to see the speech-server commands sent by Emacs when
      you
      perform a specific action, in this instance, pressing <span
      class='underline'>C-e m</span> to execute command
      <span
      class='underline'>emacspeak-speak-mode-line</span>.
      </p>
      
      <ol class='org-ol'>
      <li>In  a separate Linux  console or X-Window, launch Emacs
      with
      Emacspeak loaded — this is  separate from your primary Emacs
      session.
      </li>
      <li>In this Emacs session, use <span
      class='underline'>C-e d d</span> (command <span
      class='underline'>dtk-select-server</span>) and
      select
      <span
      
      class='underline'>log-&lt;tts-name&gt;</span> as
      the speech server, where <span
      class='underline'>tts-name</span> corresponds to
      the      speech engine you're testing.
      </li>
      <li>Emacspeak will now start the logging server, and fall
      silent;
      all  commands sent by Emacspeak to the speech-server will be logged
      to a
      file in <span class='underline'>/tmp</span>.
      </li>
      <li>Press <span class='underline'>C-e
      m</span>
      – to produce the log output you want to see.
      </li>
      <li>Use command _emacspeak-emergency-tts-restart  to get
      speech      back.
      </li>
      <li>Open a <span
      class='underline'>dired</span>
      buffer on <span class='underline'>/tmp</span>,
      press
      <span class='underline'>s</span> to sort files
      by      date, and find your generated log output at the top of the
      list.
      </li>
      <li>Note: It is useful to configure your default speech engine
      via 
      Custom – see user option  <span
      
      class='underline'>emacspeak-emergency-tts-server</span>.
      It provides a quick-fire means to get speech back if you ever switch
      to
      a speech-server that fails for some reason.

      id='outline-container-sec-2'> 
      <h2 id='sec-2'><span
      class='section-number-2'>2</span> A Brief
      History</h2> 
      <div id='text-2' class='outline-text-2'> 
      <ul class='org-ul'> 
      <li>The first five years of Emacspeak development used a local
      RCS 
      repository on my home machine (1994 –1999). 
      </li> 
      <li>The first few releases of Emacspeak were distributed
      through
      the 
      Web site and FTP server at Digital Research; they were also 
      mirrored at Cornell. 
      </li> 
      <li>After moving to Adobe Systems in the fall of 1995,
      Emacspeak
      was 
      distributed exclusively through my Web page on the Cornell CS 
      Department Web server, which also hosted my personal Web site. 
      </li> 
      <li>In 2000, I created <a
      href='http://emacspeak.sf.net'>Emacspeak On
      SourceForge</a> 
      </li> 
      </ul> 
      <p> 
      and used that site for both hosting the Emacspeak source code as 
      well as the Web site — coincidentally, I lost the ability to 
      update my Web site at <a
      href='http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman'>Cornell
      CS</a> around the same time. 
      </p> 
      <ul class='org-ul'> 
      <li>Over time it became harder and harder to publish new
      Emacspeak 
      releases through the SourceForge interface. Luckily, Google Code 
      Hosting came along a few months after I joined Google, and moving 
      the source code repository to <a
      href='http://emacspeak.googlecode.com/svn/trunk'>Google
      Code
      SVN</a> was a no-brainer. 
      </li> 
      <li>My friend and colleague Fitz helped me migrate the 5+
      years of
      CVS 
      history to SVN; this meant that the source code repository on 
      Google Code also recorded all of the development history that had 
      been built up on Sourceforge. 
      </li> 
      <li>Now, it's time to move to GitHub. I've been using
      Git
      for most of 
      my work the last few years, but was simply too lazy to move 
      Emacspeak development from SVN to Git on GoogleCode. 
      </li> 
      <li>But over time, the advantages present in Git as a source
      control 
      system and GitHub as a hosting service have increased — primary 
      among thesee — a rich set of Emacs tools that have been written 
      to leverage the GitHub API. 
      </li> 
      <li>For Git integration in Emacs, my personal preference is
      package
      Magit available through Elpa — 
      </li> 
      </ul> 
      <pre class='example'> 
      M-x package-install magit in Emacs. 
      </pre> 
      <ul class='org-ul'> 
      <li>The GitHub Web site itself is fairly heavy-weight in terms
      of
      its 
      use of scripting, i.e. performing all operations through the 
      <a href='http://github.com'>github.com</a> Web
      site
      from within Emacs is fairly unpleasant.  But 
      the afore-mentioned GitHub API makes this a non-issue at this 
      point with respect to the type of workflow I prefer. 
      </li> 
      <li>So this week, I did the work to migrate Emacspeak
      development
      to 
      <a
      href='https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak'>Emacspeak On
      GitHub</a>.

      Migration</h2> 
      <div id='text-3' class='outline-text-2'> 
      <ul class='org-ul'> 
      <li>With help from some of the kind folk at Google Code
      Hosting,
      I've 
      successfully migrated the source code repository including all 
      release tags to GitHub. 
      </li> 
      <li>I am now checking in changes into GitHub; the SVN
      repository on
      Google Code Hosting is now frozen, and I do not plan to make any 
      commits there. 
      </li> 
      <li>I presently have no immediate plans to start using
      features of 
      GitHub like the Issue Tracker; for now we will continue to use the 
      Emacspeak mailing list which has served us well for 20 years. 
      </li> 
      <li>I have also taken this opportunity to prune out legacy
      portions
      of 
      the Emacspeak codebase by moving modules to <span
      class='underline'>obsolete</span> at each 
      level of the directory tree. 
      </li> 
      <li>Since starting the <a
      href='http://emacspeak.blogspot.com'>Emacspeak
      Blog</a>
      in late 2005, I have published a 
      sequence of articles describing Emacspeak features and usage 
      patterns; I felt that having thesee articles for local reference 
      made a useful supplement to the emacspeak online 
      documentation. Toward this end, I have downloaded all articles 
      published so far and checked in both XML and HTML versions into 
      sub-directory <span
      class='underline'>blogs</span>. 
      </li>

      <p>
      I recently added a set of modules to Emacspeak to leverage some
      of the high-end audio functionality available   on Linux machines
      on modern hardware. As an example, applying effects such as 3D
      spatialization, high-end reverb effects etc. once consumed
      CPU cycles to the extent where it was not possible to play with
      thesee in realtime. All thesee now take less than 1–5% of the CPU,
      and that when my laptop is running in power-save mode!

      <p>
      Sound Exchange (SoX), described as the Swiss army knife of sound
      processing, has been around since the time I was a graduate
      student. Today it provides a versatile set of tools for editing
      and manipulating both wave and mp3 files. Module sox.el
      implements a simple Audio Workbench for the Emacspeak desktop.

      <li>Launch the Audio Workbench via  by  executing <span

      <li>Use upper-case <span

      <div id='text-1-2' class='outline-text-3'>
      <p>
      I use <span class='underline'>mplayer</span> to
      play
      both local and network media
      streams. MPlayer can apply a wide range of filters to the audio
      stream; more interestingly it can also apply effects implemented
      as Ladspa plugins.   Package <span
      class='underline'>tap-plugins</span> implements a
      large
      number of high-quality Ladspa filters, including a versatile
      <span class='underline'>Reverb</span> filter.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Once you have package <span
      class='underline'>tap-plugins</span> and its
      dependenciesinstalled, and a relatively new version of MPlayer (with
      support
      for Ladspa plugins), you can now apply various <i>Reverb
      Presets</i>
      to your media streams via Emacspeak MPlayer command
      <span
      
      
      class='underline'>emacspeak-m-player-apply-reverb-preset</span> bound to <span class='underline'>P</span> in
      Emacspeak MPlayer. Package <span
      class='underline'>tap-plugins</span> defines a
      total of
      42
      Reverb Presets, experiment with thesee when wearing headsets.
      Once you have applied a Reverb Preset, you can edit its current
      settings via command emacspeak-m-player-edit-reverb  bound to
      <span
      class='underline'>R</span>
      in Emacspeak MPlayer.
      Alternatively, you can pick a default effect to use via Emacs'
      custom interface; see option  <span

      <p>
      Finally, You can now bind shortcut keys for launching Emacspeak
      MPlayer   from specific locations where you store media, e.g.,
      you can have separate shortcuts for <i>Music</i> vs
      <i>Audio Books</i> –
      see command <span
      
      class='underline'>emacspeak-m-player-accelerator</span>.
      This is best used by customizing Emacspeak option
      <span
      
      
      class='underline'>emacspeak-media-location-bindings</span> — just use the Customize

      this command is
      bound to _;</span> in  EWW.

      <li>You need to provide an interactive prefix argument to the
      above command to indicate that it is a playlist — so you
      actually press <span class='underline'>C-u

      on audio links.
      </li>
      <li>Many of the audio links do not return a playlist – they
      instead return a link that is a pointer to a playlist. Newer

      <p>
      where &lt;url&gt; is the URL of the audio link, then  pass

      <a href='http://www.csounds.com/'>CSound</a> is
      a      sophisticated music sound syntheseis system with a
      strong community of developers.  I've played off and on with
      CSound ever since the early 90's  and have always been intrigued
      by the possibility of   algorithmically creating new auditory icon
      themes
      for
      Emacspeak  using CSound.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Over the holidays last December, I finally got around to creating
      my first complete CSound-generated auditory icon theme – it is
      now checked into Emacspeak SVN as theme <a
      
      
      href='http://emacspeak.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/sounds/3d/'>3d</a>. This theme is best
      experienced with headphones — many of the generated icons use
      spatial audio to good effect.

      of the Internet such as Web-surfing, blogging, social computing 
      and electronic messaging into the audio desktop, Emacspeak 
      enables speech access to local and remote information with a 
      consistent and well-integrated user interface. A rich suite of 
      task-oriented tools provides efficient speech-enabled access to

      <p> 
      Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all 
      major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular, 
      distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated 
      system without any undue pressure—a documented success for 
      the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system 
      evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at 
      the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak 
      codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform 
      used to develop and distribute the software. 
      </p> 
      
      <p> 
      Extensive studies have shown that thanks to thesee features, users 
      consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this 
      wide-spread user demand, the present version remains   priceless 
      as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as 
      previous releases. 
      </p> 
      
      <p> 
      At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of 
      eyes-free social interaction and carries forward the 
      well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user 
      interface features that eventually show up in luser environments. 
      </p> 
      
      <p> 
      On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a 
      crash-prone but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion 
      "Emacs is a system from the 70's", the creator of
      Emacspeak
      evinced surprise at the unusual candor manifest in the assertion 
      that it would take popular idiot-proven interfaces until the year 
      2070 to catch up to where the Emacspeak audio desktop is 
      today. Industry experts welcomed this refreshing breath of 
      Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time when users are 
      reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) unleashed by 
      complex software systems backed by even more convoluted press 
      releases.

      <p> 
      Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and 
      not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without
            adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer.
      These 
      same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped 
      functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of
            Emacspeak once pointed out that thesee results re-emphasize the
            user-centric design of Emacspeak; "It is the user –and
      not the 
      computer– that stops functioning when Emacspeak is
      uninstalled!".

      <p> 
      Emacspeak 41.0 continues to improve upon the desire to provide 
      not just equal, but superior access — technology  
      when correctly implemented can significantly enhance the human 
      ability. Emacspeak 40.0 goes back to Web basics by enabling 
      <a
      
      
      href='http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2013/11/reading-web-content-efficiently.html'>efficient access</a> to large amounts of readable Web

      a new dog old tricks — and is aptly code-named HeadDog in honor 
      of our new Press/Analyst contact. emacspeak-34.0 (AKA Bubbles) 
      established a new beach-head with respect to rapid task

      SocialDog brings the Social Web to the audio desktop—you can't but 
      be social if you speak! Emacspeak 29.0—AKAAbleDog—is a testament
            to the resilliance and innovation embodied by Open Source 
      software—it would not exist without the thriving Emacs community 
      that continues to ensure that Emacs remains one of the premier 
      user environments despite perhaps also being one of the 
      oldest. Emacspeak 28.0—AKA PuppyDog—exemplifies the rapid pace
      of 
      development evinced by Open Source software. Emacspeak 27.0—AKA 
      FastDog—is the latest in a sequence of upgrades that make 
      previous releases obsolete and downgrades unnecessary. Emacspeak 
      26—AKA LeadDog—continues the tradition of introducing innovative
            access solutions that are unfettered by the constraints
      inherent 
      in traditional adaptive technologies. Emacspeak 25 —AKA ActiveDog 
      —re-activates open, unfettered access to online 
      information. Emacspeak-Alive —AKA LiveDog —enlivens open, 
      unfettered information access with a series of live updates that 
      once again demonstrate the power and agility of open source 
      software development. Emacspeak 23.0 – AKA Retriever—went the 
      extra mile in fetching full access. Emacspeak 22.0 —AKA GuideDog 
      —helps users navigate the Web more effectively than ever 
      before. Emacspeak 21.0 —AKA PlayDog —continued the Emacspeak 
      tradition of relying on enhanced productivity to liberate 
      users. Emacspeak-20.0 —AKA LeapDog —continues the long 
      established GNU/Emacs tradition of integrated innovation to

      ownership. Emacspeak-17.0 –code named HappyDog– enhances user 
      productivity by exploiting today's evolving WWW 
      standards. Emacspeak-16.0 –code named CleverDog– the follow-up 
      to SmartDog– continued the tradition of working better, faster, 
      smarter. Emacspeak-15.0 –code named SmartDog–followed up on 
      TopDog as the next in a continuing a series of award-winning 
      audio desktop releases from Emacspeak Inc. Emacspeak-14.0 –code 
      named TopDog–was the first release of this 
      millennium. Emacspeak-13.0 –codenamed YellowLab– was the 
      closing release of the 20th. century. Emacspeak-12.0 –code named 
      GoldenDog– began leveraging the evolving semantic WWW to provide 
      task-oriented speech access to Webformation. Emacspeak-11.0 
      –code named Aster– went the final step in making Linux a 
      zero-cost Internet access solution for blind and visually 
      impaired users. Emacspeak-10.0 –(AKA Emacspeak-2000) code named 
      WonderDog– continued the tradition of award-winning software 
      releases designed to make eyes-free computing a productive and 
      pleasurable experience. Emacspeak-9.0 –(AKA Emacspeak 99) code 
      named BlackLab– continued to innovate in the areas of speech 
      interaction and interactive accessibility. Emacspeak-8.0 –(AKA 
      Emacspeak-98++) code named BlackDog– was a major upgrade to the 
      speech output extension to Emacs. 
      </p> 
      
      <p> 
      Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois) was released as OpenSource on 
      the Internet in May 1995 as the first complete speech interface 
      to UNIX workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96 (code 
      named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant 
      enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went 
      further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98 
      integrated Internetworking into all aspects of the audio desktop 
      to provide the first fully interactive speech-enabled WebTop.

      <p>
      One afternoon in the third week of September 1994, I started
      writing myself a small Emacs extension using Lisp Advice to make
      Emacs speak to me so I could use a Linux laptop. As Emacspeak
      turns twenty, this article is both a quick look back over the
      twenty years of lessons learned, as well as a glimpse into what
      might be possible as we evolve to a world of connected,
      ubiquitous computing. This article draws on <a
      href='http://norvig.com/21-days.html'>Learning To Program
      In 10 Years</a> by Peter Norvig for some of its inspiration.

      <p>
      As a graduate student at <a
      
      
      href='http://www.cs.cornell.edu/info/people/raman/raman.html'>Cornell</a>, I accessed my Unix workstation
      (SunOS) from an Intel 486 PC running IBM Screen-Reader. There
      was no means of directly using a UNIX box at the time; after
      graduating, I continued doing the same for about six months at
      Digital Research in Cambridge — the only difference being that
      my desktop workstation was now a DEC-Alpha. Throughout this
      time, Emacs was my environment of choice for everything from
      software development and Internet access to writing documents.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
      In fall of 1994, I wanted to start using a laptop running Linux;
      a colleague (Dave Wecker) was retiring his 386mhz laptop that
      already had Linux on it and I decided to inherit it. But there
      was only one problem — until then I had always accessed a UNIX
      machine from a secondary PC running a screen-reader — something
      that would clearly make no sense with a laptop!
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Another colleague, Win Treese, had pointed out the interesting
      possibilities presented by package <b>advice</b> in
      Emacs      19.23 — a
      few weeks earlier, he had sent around a small snippet of code
      that magically modified Emacs' version-control primitive to
      first      create an <i>RCS</i> directory if none
      existed before adding
      a file to
      version control. When I speculated about using the Linux laptop,
      Dave remarked — you live in Emacs anyway — why dont you just
      make      it talk!
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Connecting the dots, I decided to write myself a tool that
      augmented Emacs' default behavior to <i>speak</i>
      —      within about 4
      hours, version 0.01 of Emacspeak was up and running.

      <p>
      It took me a couple of weeks to fully recognize the potential of
      what I had built with Emacs Lisp Advice. Until then, I had used
      screen-readers to listen to the contents of the visual display —
      but Lisp Advice let me do a lot more — it enabled Emacspeak to
      generate highly context-specific spoken feedback, augmented by a
      set of auditory icons. I later formalized this design under the
      name <a
      
      
      href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-voicing'>speech-enabled applications</a>. For a detailed overview of the

            Text To Speech (TTS)</h2>
      <div id='text-4' class='outline-text-2'>
      <p>
      Emacspeak is a speech-subsystem for Emacs; it depends on an
      external Text-To-Speech (TTS) engine to produce speech. In 1994,
      Digital Equipment released what would turn out to be the last in
      the line of hardware DECTalk syntheseizers, the DECTalk
      Express. This was essentially an Intel 386with 1mb of flash
      memory that ran a version of the DECTalk TTS software — to date,
      it still remains my favorite Text-To-Speech engine. At the time,
      I also had a software version of the same engine running on my
      DEC-Alpha workstation; the desire to use either a software or
      hardware solution to produce speech output defined the Emacspeak
      speech-server architecture.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      I went to IBM Research in 1999; this coincided with IBM releasing
      a version of the Eloquennce TTS engine on Linux under the name
      <i>ViaVoice Outloud</i>. My colleague Jeffrey Sorenson
      implemented an
      early version of the Emacspeak speech-server for this engine
      using the OSS API; I later updated it to use the ALSA library
      while on a flight back to SFO from Boston in 2001. That is still
      the TTS engine that is speaking as I type this article on my
      laptop.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      20 years on, TTS continues to be the weakest link on Linux; the
      best available solution in terms of quality continues to be the
      Linux port of Eloquence TTS available from Voxin in Europe for a
      small price. Looking back across 20 years, the state of TTS on
      Linux in particular and across all platforms in general continues
      to be a disappointment; most of today's newer TTS engines are
      geared toward mainstream use-cases where
      <i>naturalness</i>
      of the
      voice tends to supersede intelligibility at higher
      speech-rates. Ironically, modern TTS engines also give
      applications far less control over the generated output — as a
      case in point, I implemented
      <a
      
      
      href='http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/aster/demo.html'>Audio System For Technical Readings (AsTeR)</a> in 1994 using the
      DECTalk; 20 years later, we implemented <a

      <a
      href='http://www.chromevox.com/'>ChromeVox</a>     
      using Google TTS. In 2013, it turned out to be
      difficult or impossible to implement the type of audio renderings
      that were possible with the admittedly less-natural sounding
      DECTalk!

      <p>
      Version 0.01 of Emacspeak was written using IBM Screen-Reader on
      a PC with a terminal emulator accessing a UNIX workstation. But
      in about 2 weeks, Emacspeak was already a better environment for
      developing Emacspeak in particular and software development in
      general. Here are a few highlights in 1994 that made Emacspeak a
      good software development environment, present-day users of
      Emacspeak will see that that was just scratching the surface.
      </p>
      
      <ul class='org-ul'>
      <li>Audio formatting using voice-lock to provide aural syntax
      highlighting.
      </li>
      <li>Succinct auditory icons to provide efficient feedback.
      </li>
      <li>Emacs' ability to navigate code structurally   — 
      </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      as opposed to moving around by plain-text units such as
      characters, lines and words. S-Expressions are a major win!
      </p>
      <ul class='org-ul'>
      <li>Emacs' ability to specialize behavior based on major
      and
      minor modes.
      </li>
      <li>Ability to browse program code using  tags, and getting
      fluent spoken feedback.
      </li>
      <li>Completion <b>everywhere</b>.
      </li>
      <li>Everything is searchable   —   this is a huge win when
      you
      cannot see the screen.
      </li>
      <li>Interactive spell-checking using ISpell with continuous
      spoken feedback augmented by aural highlights.
      </li>
      <li>Running code compilation  and being able to jump to errors
      with spoken feedback.
      </li>
      <li>Ability to move through diff chunks when working with
      source
      code and source control systems; refined diffs as provided by
      the <b>ediff</b> package when speech-enabled is a major
      productivity win.
      </li>
      <li>Ability to easily move between email, document authoring
      and
      programming — though this may appear trivial, it continues to
      be one of Emacs' biggest wins.
      </li>
      </ul>
      
      
      <p>
      Long-term Emacs users will recognize all of the above as being
      among the reasons why they do most things inside Emacs — there is
      little that is Emacspeak specific in the above list — except that
      Emacspeak was able to provide fluent, well-integrated contextual
      feedback for all of thesee tasks. And that was a game-changer
      given what I had had before Emacspeak. As a case in point, I did
      not dare program in Python before I speech-enabled Emacs'
      Python-Mode; the fact that white space is significant in Python
      made it difficult to program using a plain screen-reader that was
      unaware of the semantics of the underlying content being
      accessed.

      <p>
      As an aside, note that all of Emacspeak has been developed over
      the last 20 years with Emacspeak being the only adaptive
      technology on my system. This has led to  some interesting design
      consequences, primary among them being  a strong education in
      <b>programming defensively</b>.  Here are some other key
      features of
      the Emacspeak code-base:
      </p>
      
      <ol class='org-ol'>
      <li>The code-base is extremely <b>bushy</b> rather
      than
      deeply
      hierarchical — this means that when a module breaks, it does
      not affect the rest of the system.
      </li>
      <li>Separation of concerns with respect to the various layers,
      a
      tightly knit  core speech library  interfaces  with  any one
      of many  speech servers  running as an external process.
      </li>
      <li>Audio formatting is abstracted by using the formalism
      defined in Aural CSS.
      </li>
      <li>Emacspeak integrates with Emacs' user interface
      conventions
      by taking over a single prefix key <b>C-e</b> with
      <i>all</i>
      Emacspeak commands accessed through that single keymap.
      This helps embedding Emacspeak functionality into a large
      variety of third party modules without any loss of functionality.

      Authoring Documents</h2>
      <div id='text-6' class='outline-text-2'>
      <p>
      In 1994, my preferred environment for authoring
      <b>all</b>
      documents
      was <b>LaTeX</b> using the Auctex package. Later I
      started
      writing
      either LaTeX or HTML using the appropriate support modes; today I
      use <b>org-mode</b> to do most of my content authoring.
      Personally, I
      have never been a fan of What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG)
      authoring tools — in my experience that places an undue burden on
      the author by drawing attention away from the content to focus on
      the final appearance. An added benefit of creating content in
      Emacs in the form of light-weight markup is that the content is
      long-lived — I can still usefully process and re-use things I
      have written 25 years ago.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Emacs, with Emacspeak providing audio formatting and
      context-specific feedback remains my environment of choice for
      writing all forms of content ranging from simple email messages
      to polished documents for print publishing. And it is worth
      repeating that I <b>never</b> need to focus on what the
      content is
      going to look like — that job is best left to the computer.

      Right around the time that I was writing version 0.01 of
      emacspeak, a far more significant software movement was under way
      — the World Wide Web was moving from the realms of academia to
      the mainstream world with the launch of NCSA Mosaic — and in late
      1994 by the first commercial Web browser in Netscape
      Navigator. Emacs had always enabled integrated access to FTP
      archives via package <i>ange-ftp</i>; in late 1993,
      William
      Perry
      released Emacs-W3, a Web browser for Emacs written entirely in
      Emacs Lisp. W3 was one of the first large packages to be
      speech-enabled by Emacspeak — later it was the browser on which I
      implemented the first draft of the
      <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/aural.html'>Aural
      CSS
      specification</a>. Emacs-W3 enabled many early innovations in
      the
      context of providing non-visual access to Web content, including
      audio formatting and structured content navigation; in summer of
      1995, Dave Raggett and I outlined a few extensions to HTML Forms,
      including the <b>label</b> element as a means of
      associating
      metadata
      with interactive form controls in HTML, and many of thesee ideas
      were prototyped in Emacs-W3 at the time. Over the years, Emacs-W3
      fell behind the times — especially as the Web moved away from
      cleanly structured HTML to a massive soup of unmatched tags. This
      made parsing and error-correcting badly-formed HTML markup
      expensive to do in Emacs-Lisp — and performance suffered. To add
      to this, mainstream users moved away because Emacs' rendering
      engine at the time was not rich enough to provide the type of
      visual renderings that users had come to expect. The advent of
      DHTML, and JavaScript based Web Applications finally killed off
      Emacs-W3 as far as most Emacs users were concerned.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      But Emacs-W3 went through a revival on the emacspeak audio
      desktop in late 1999 with the arrival of XSLT, and Daniel
      Veillard's excellent implementation via the
      <b>libxml2</b> and
      <b>libxslt</b> packages. With thesee in hand, Emacspeak
      was
      able to
      hand-off the bulk of HTML error correction to the
      <b>xsltproc</b>
      tool. The lack of visual fidelity didn't matter much for an
      eyes-free environment; so Emacs-W3 continued to be a useful tool
      for consuming large amounts of Web content that did not require
      JavaScript support.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      During the last 24 months, <b>libxml2</b> has been built
      into
      Emacs;
      this means that you can now parse arbitrary HTML as found in the
      willd without incurring a performance hit. This functionality was
      leveraged first by package <b>shr</b> (Simple HTML
      Renderer)
      within
      the <b>gnus</b> package for rendering HTML email. Later,
      the
      author of
      <b>gnus</b> and <b>shr</b> created a new
      light-weight HTML viewer called
      <b>eww</b> that is now part of Emacs 24. With improved
      support for
      variable pitch fonts and image embedding, Emacs is once again
      able to provide visual renderings for a large proportion of
      text-heavy Web content where it becomes useful for mainstream
      Emacs users to view at least some Web content within Emacs;
      during the last year, I have added support within emacspeak to
      <a
      
      
      href='http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2014/05/emacspeak-eww-updates-for-complete.html'>extend package <b>eww</b></a> with support for DOM filtering and quick
      content navigation.

      — 
      Generalizing Aural CSS</h2>
      <div id='text-8' class='outline-text-2'>
      <p>
      A key idea in Audio System For Technical Readings <a
      
      
      href='http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/aster/aster-toplevel.html'>(AsTeR)</a> was the
      use of various voice properties in combination with non-speech
      auditory icons to create rich aural renderings. When I
      implemented Emacspeak, I brought over the notion of audio
      formatting to all buffers in Emacs by creating a
      <b>voice-lock</b>
      module that paralleled Emacs' <b>font-lock</b>
      module.
      The visual
      medium is far richer in terms of available fonts and colors as
      compared to voice parameters available on TTS engines —
      consequently, it did not make sense to directly map Emacs'
      <b>face</b>
      properties to voice parameters. To aid in projecting visual
      formatting onto auditory space, I created property
      <b>personality</b>
      analogous to Emacs' <b>face</b> property that could
      be
      applied to
      content displayed in Emacs; module <b>voice-lock</b>
      applied
      that
      property appropriately, and the Emacspeak core handled the
      details of mapping personality values to the underlying TTS
      engine.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      The values used in property <b>personality</b> were
      abstract,
      i.e.,
      they were independent of any given speech engine. Later in the
      fall of 1995, I re-expressed thesee set of abstract voice
      properties in terms of Aural CSS; the work was published as a
      first draft toward the end of 1995, and implemented in Emacs-W3
      in early 1996. Aural CSS was an appendix in the CSS-1.0
      specification; later, it graduated to being its own module within
      CSS-2.0.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Later in 1996, all of Emacs' <b>voice-lock</b>
      functionality was
      re-implemented in terms of Aural CSS; the implementation has
      stood the test of time in that as I added support for more TTS
      engines, I was able to implement engine-specific mappings of
      Aural-CSS values. This meant that the rest of Emacspeak could
      define various types of voices for use in specific contexts
      without having to worry about individual TTS
      engines. Conceptually, property <b>personality</b> can
      be      thought of
      as holding an <b>aural display list</b> — various
      parts of
      the system
      can annotate pieces of text with relevant properties that finally
      get rendered in the aggregate. This model also works well with
      the notion of Emacs overlays where a moving overlay is used to
      temporarily highlight text that has other context-specific
      properties applied to it.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
      Audio formatting as implemented in Emacspeak is extremely
      effective when working with all types of content ranging from
      richly structured mark-up documents (LaTeX, org-mode) and
      formatted Web pages to program source code. Perceptually,
      switching to audio formatted output feels like switching from a
      black-and-white monitor to a rich color display. Today,
      Emacspeak's audio formatted output is the only way I can
      correctly write <b>else if</b> vs
      <b>elsif</b> in
      various programming
      languages!

      Gestures For The Audio Desktop</h2>
      <div id='text-9' class='outline-text-2'>
      <p>
      By 1996, Emacspeak was the only piece of adaptive technology I
      used; in fall of 1995, I had moved to Adobe Systems from DEC
      Research to focus on enhancing the Portable Document Format (PDF)
      to make PDF content repurposable. Between 1996 and 1998, I was
      primarily focused on electronic document formats — I took this
      opportunity to step back and evaluate what I had built as an
      auditory interface within Emacspeak. This retrospect proved
      extremely useful in gaining a sense of perspective and led to
      formalizing the high-level concept of <i>Conversational
      Gestures</i>
      and structured browsing/searching as a means of thinking about
      user interfaces.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      By now, Emacspeak was a complete environment — I formalized what
      it provided under the moniker <i>Complete Audio
      Desktop</i>.
      The fully
      integrated user experience allowed me to move forward with
      respect to defining interaction models that were highly optimized
      to eyes-free interaction — as an example, see how Emacspeak
      interfaces with modes like <b>dired</b> (Directory
      Editor)
      forbrowsing and manipulating the filesystem, or
      <b>proced</b>
      (Process
      Editor) for browsing and manipulating running processes. Emacs'
      integration with <b>ispell</b> for spell checking, as
      well as
      its
      various completion facilities ranging from minibuffer completion
      to other forms of dynamic completion while typing text provided
      more opportunities for creating innovative forms of eyes-free
      interaction. With respect to what had gone before (and is still
      par for the course as far as traditional screen-readers are
      concerned), thesee types of highly dynamic interfaces present a
      challenge. For example, consider handling a completion interface
      using a screen-reader that is speaking the visual display. There
      is a significant challenge in deciding <i>what to
      speak</i>
      e.g., when
      presented with a list of completions, the currently typed text,
      and the default completion, which of thesee should you speak, and
      in what order? The problem gets harder when you consider that the
      underlying semantics of thesee items is generally not available
      from examining the visual presentation in a consistent manner. By
      having direct access to the underlying information being
      presented, Emacspeak had a leg up with respect to addressing the
      higher-level question — when you do have access to this
      information, how do you present it effectively in an eyes-free
      environment? For this and many other cases of dynamic
      interaction, a combination of audio formatting, auditory icons,
      and the ability to syntheseize succinct messages from a
      combination of information items — rather than having to forcibly
      speak each item as it is rendered visually provided for highly
      efficient eyes-free interaction.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
      This was also when I stepped back to build out Emacspeak's table
      browsing facilities — see the online Emacspeak documentation for
      details on Emacspeak's table browsing functionality which
      continues to remain one of the richest collection of end-user
      affordances for working with two-dimensional data.

      Interactive Games</h3>
      <div id='text-9-1' class='outline-text-3'>
      <p>
      So in 1997, I went the next step in asking — given access to the
      underlying information, is it possible to build effective
      eyes-free interaction to highly interactive tasks? I picked
      <b>Tetris</b> as a means of exploring this space, the
      result
      was an
      Emacspeak extension to speech-enable module
      <b>tetris.el</b>.
      The
      details of what was learned were published as a paper in Assets
      98, and expanded as a chapter on Conversational Gestures in my
      book on Auditory Interfaces; that book was in a sense a
      culmination of stepping back and gaining a sense of perspective
      of what I had build during this period. The work on
      Conversational Gestures also helped in formalizing the abstract
      user interface layer that formed part of the
      <a
      href='http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/'>XForms</a>
      work at the W3C.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Speech-enabling games for effective eyes-free interaction has
      proven highly educational. Interactive games are typically built
      to challenge the user, and if the eyes-free interface is
      inefficient, you just won't play the game — contrast this with a
      task that you <b>must</b> perform, where you're
      likely to
      make do with
      a sub-optimal interface. Over the years, Emacspeak has come to
      include eyes-free interfaces to several games including <a
      
      href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris'>Tetris</a>,
      <a
      
      
      href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)'>Sudoku</a>, and of late the popular <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)'>2048 game</a>. Each of thesee have in
      turn contributed to enhancing the interaction model in Emacspeak,
      and those innovations typically make their way to the rest of the
      environment.

      <div id='text-10' class='outline-text-2'>
      <p>
      Streaming real-time audio on the Internet became a reality with
      the advent of RealAudio in 1995; soon there were a large number
      of media streams available on the Internet ranging from music
      streams to live radio stations. But there was an interesting
      twist — for the most part, all of thesee media streams expected
      one to look at the screen, even though the primary content was
      purely audio (streaming video hadn't arrived yet!). Starting in
      1996, Emacspeak started including a variety of eyes-free
      front-ends for accessing media streams. Initially, this was
      achieved by building a wrapper around <b>trplayer</b>
      — a
      headless
      version of RealPlayer; later I built Emacspeak module
      <b>emacspeak-m-player</b> for interfacing with package
      <b>mplayer</b>. A
      key aspect of streaming media integration in emacspeak is that
      one can launch and control streams without ever switching away
      from one's primary task; thus, you can continue to type email or
      edit code while seamlessly launching and controlling media
      streams. Over the years, Emacspeak has come to integrate with
      Emacs packages like <b>emms</b> as well as providing
      wrappers
      for
      <b>mplayer</b> and <b>alsaplayer</b> —
      collectively, thesee let you
      efficiently launch all types of media streams, including
      streaming video, without having to explicitly switch context.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
      In the mid-90's, Emacspeak started including a directory of
      media      links to some of the more popular radio stations —
      primarily as a
      means of helping users getting started — Emacs' ability to
      rapidly complete directory and file-names turned out to be the
      most effective means of quickly launching everything from
      streaming radio stations to audio books. And even better — as the
      Emacs community develops better and smarter ways of navigating
      the filesystem using completions, e.g., package
      <b>ido</b>,
      thesee
      types of actions become even more efficient!

      AsTeR — was motivated by the increasing availability of technical
      material as online electronic documents. While AsTeR processed
      the TeX family of markup languages, more general ebooks came in a
      wide range of formats, ranging from plain text generated from
      various underlying file formats to structured EBooks, with
      Project <a
      href='http://www.gutenberg.org/'>Gutenberg</a>
      leading
      the way. During the mid-90's, I had
      access to a wide range of electronic materials from sources such
      as O'Reilly Publishing and various electronic journals — The
      Perl
      Journal (TPJ) is one that I still remember fondly.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Emacspeak provided fairly light-weight but efficient access to
      all of the electronic books I had on my local disk — Emacs'
      strengths with respect to browsing textual documents meant that I
      needed to build little that was specific to Emacspeak. The late
      90's saw the arrival of Daisy as an XML-based format for
      accessible electronic books. The last decade has seen the rapid
      convergence to <b>epub</b> as a distribution format of
      choice
      for
      electronic books. Emacspeak provides interaction modes that make
      organizing, searching and reading thesee materials on the
      Emacspeak Audio Desktop a pleasant experience. Emacspeak also
      provides an OCR-Mode — this enables one to call out to an
      external OCR program and read the content efficiently.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      The somewhat informal process used by publishers like O'Reilly
      to      make technical material available to users with print
      impairments
      was later formalized by <a
      href='https://www.bookshare.org/'>BookShare</a> —
      today, qualified users can
      obtain a large number of books and periodicals initially as
      Daisy-3 and increasingly as <b>EPub</b>. BookShare
      provides a
      RESTful
      API for searching and downloading books; Emacspeak module
      <b>emacspeak-bookshare</b> implements this API to create
      a
      client for
      browsing the BookShare library, downloading and organizing books
      locally, and an integrated ebook reading mode to round off the
      experience.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      A useful complement to this suite of tools is the Calibre package
      for organizing ones ebook collection; Emacspeak now implements an
      <b>EPub Interaction</b> mode that leverages Calibre
      (actually
      sqlite3)
      to search and browse books, along with an integrated <b>EPub
      mode</b>

      The ability to invoke external processes and interface with them
      via a simple read-eval-loop (REPL) is perhaps one of Emacs'
      strongest extension points. This means that a wide variety of
      computational tools become immediately available for embedding
      within the Emacs environment — a facility that has been widely
      exploited by the Emacs community. Over the years, Emacspeak has
      leveraged many of thesee facilities to provide a well-integrated
      auditory interface.

      Notebooks provide an easy means of reaching a large audience when

      <div id='text-13' class='outline-text-2'>
      <p>
      The ability to process large amounts of email and electronic news
      has always been a feature of Emacs. I started using package
      <b>vm</b>
      for email in 1990, along with <b>gnus</b> for Usenet
      access
      many years
      before developing Emacspeak. So thesee were the first major
      packages that Emacspeak speech-enabled. Being able to access the
      underlying data structures used to visually render email messages
      and Usenet articles enabled Emacspeak to produce rich, succinct
      auditory output — this vastly increased my ability to consume and
      organize large amounts of information. Toward the turn of the
      century, instant messaging arrived in the mainstream — package
      <b>tnt</b> provided an Emacs implementation of a chat
      client
      that
      could communicate with users on the then popular AOL Instant
      Messenger platform. At the time, I worked at IBM Research, and
      inspired by package <b>tnt</b>, I created an Emacs
      client      called
      <b>ChatterBox</b> using the Lotus Sametime API — this
      enabled me to
      communicate with colleagues at work from the comfort of
      Emacs. Packages like <b>vm</b>, <b>gnus</b>,
      <b>tnt</b> and <b>ChatterBox</b> provide
      an interesting example of how availability of a clean underlying
      API to a specific service or content stream can encourage the
      creation of efficient (and different) user interfaces. The
      touchstone of such successful implementations is a simple test —
      can the user of a specific interface tell if the person whom he
      is communicating with is also using the same interface? In each
      of the examples enumerated above, a user at one end of the
      communication chain cannot tell, and in fact shouldn't be able
      to      tell what client the user at the other end is using.
      Contrast      this with closed services that have an inherent
      <i>lock-in</i> model

      Today, my personal choice for instant messaging is the open
      Jabber platform. I connect to Jabber via Emacs package
      <b>emacs-jabber</b> and with Emacspeak providing a
      light-weight
      wrapper for generating the eyes-free interface, I can communicate
      seamlessly with colleagues and friends around the world.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      As the Web evolved to encompass ever-increasing swathese of
      communication functionality that had already been available on
      the Internet, we saw the world move from Usenet groups to
      <b>Blogs</b>
      — I remember initially dismissing the blogging phenomenon as just
      a re-invention of Usenet in the early days. However, mainstream
      users flocked to Blogging, and I later realized that blogging as
      a publishing platform brought along interesting features that
      made communicating and publishing information
      <b>much</b>      easier. In
      2005, I joined Google; during the winter holidays that year, I
      implemented a light-weight client for Blogger that became the
      start of Emacs package <b>g-client</b> — this package
      provides Emacs
      wrappers for Google services that provide a RESTful API.

      — 
      Web Wizards And URL Templates For Faster Access</h2>
      <div id='text-14' class='outline-text-2'>
      <p>
      Today, the Web, based on URLs and HTTP-style protocols is widely
      recognized as a platform in its own right. This platform emerged
      over time — to me, Web APIs arrived in the late 90's when I
      observed the following with respect to my own behavior on many
      popular sites:
      </p>
      
      <ol class='org-ol'>
      <li>I opened a Web page that took a while to load (remember, 
      I      was still using Emacs-W3),
      </li>
      <li>I then searched through the page to find a form-field that
      I filled out, e.g., start and end destinations on Yahoo
      Maps,
      </li>
      <li>I hit <b>submit</b>, and once again waited for
      a
      heavy-weight
      HTML page to load,
      </li>
      <li>And finally, I hunted through the rendered content to find
      what I was looking for.
      </li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
      This pattern repeated across a wide-range of interactive Web
      sites ranging from AltaVista for search (this was pre-Google),
      Yahoo Maps for directions, and Amazon for product searches to
      name but a few. So I decided to automate away the pain by
      creating Emacspeak module <b>emacspeak-websearch</b>
      that did
      the
      following:
      </p>
      
      <ol class='org-ol'>
      <li>Prompt via the minibuffer for the requisite fields,
      </li>
      <li>Consed up an HTTP GET URL,
      </li>
      <li>Retrieved this URL,
      </li>
      <li>And filtered out the specific portion of the HTML  DOM
      that      held the generated response.
      </li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
      Notice that the above implementation hard-wires the CGI parameter
      names used by a given Web application into the code implemented
      in module <b>emacspeak-websearch</b>. REST as a design
      pattern had not
      yet been recognized, leave alone formalized, and module
      <b>emacspeak-websearch</b> was initially decryed as
      being      fragile.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      However, over time, the CGI parameter names remained fixed — the
      only things that have required updating in the Emacspeak
      code-base are the content filtering rules that extract the
      response — for popular services, this has averaged about one to
      two times a year.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
      I later codified thesee filtering rules in terms of XPath, and
      also integrated XSLT-based pre-processing of incoming HTML
      content before it got handed off to Emacs-W3 — and yes,
      Emacs/Advice once again came in handy with respect to injecting
      XSLT pre-processing into Emacs-W3!
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Later, in early 2000, I created companion module
      <b>emacspeak-url-templates</b> — partially inspired by
      Emacs'
      <b>webjump</b> module. URL templates in Emacspeak
      leveraged
      the
      recognized REST interaction pattern to provide a large collection
      of Web widgets that could be quickly invoked to provide rapid
      access to the right pieces of information on the Web.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      The final icing on the cake was the arrival of RSS and Atom feeds
      and the consequent deep-linking into content-rich sites — this
      meant that Emacspeak could provide audio renderings of useful
      content without having to deal with complex visual navigation!
      While Google Reader existed, Emacspeak provided a light-weight
      <b>greader</b> client for managing ones feed
      subscriptions;
      with the
      demise of Google Reader, I implemented module
      <b>emacspeak-feeds</b>
      for organizing feeds on the Emacspeak desktop. A companion
      package <b>emacspeak-webspace</b> implements additional
      goodies
      including a continuously updating ticker of headlines taken from
      the user's collection of subscribed feeds.

      — 
      Leveraging Evolving Web APIs</h2>
      <div id='text-15' class='outline-text-2'>
      <p>
      The next step in this evolution came with the arrival of richer
      Web APIs — especially ones that defined a clean client/server
      separation. In this respect, the world of Web APIs is a somewhat
      mixed bag in that many Web sites equate a Web API with a JS-based
      API that can be exclusively invoked from within a Web-Browser
      run-time. The issue with that type of API binding is that the
      only runtime that is supported is a full-blown Web browser; but
      the arrival of native mobile apps has actually proven a net
      positive in encouraging sites to create a cleaner
      separation. Emacspeak has leveraged thesee APIs to create
      Emacspeak front-ends to many useful services, here are a few:
      </p>
      
      <ol class='org-ol'>
      <li>Minibuffer completion for Google Search using Google
      Suggest
      to provide completions.
      </li>
      <li>Librivox for browsing  and playing free audio books.
      </li>
      <li>NPR  for browsing and playing NPR archived programs.
      </li>
      <li>BBC for playing a wide variety of streaming content
      available from the BBC.
      </li>
      <li>A Google Maps front-end that  provides instantaneous
      access      to directions and Places search.
      </li>
      <li>Access to Twitter via package
      <b>twittering-mode</b>.
      </li>
      </ol>
      
      
      <p>
      And a lot more than will fit this margin! This is an example of
      generalizing the concept of a mashup as seen on the Web with
      respect to creating hybrid applications by bringing together a
      collection of different Web APIs. Another way to think of such
      separation is to view an application as a <b>head</b>
      and a
      <b>body</b> —
      where the <b>head</b> is a specific user interface, with
      the
      <b>body</b>
      implementing the application logic. A cleanly defined separation
      between the <b>head</b> and <b>body</b>
      allows
      one to attach <i>different</i>
      user interfaces i.e., <b>heads</b> to the given
      <b>body</b> without any
      loss of functionality, or the need to re-implement the entire
      application. Modern platforms like Android enable such separation
      via an
      <a
      
      
      href='http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html'>Intent</a>
      mechanism. The Web platform as originally defined around URLs is
      actually well-suited to this type of separation — though the full
      potential of this design pattern remains to be fully realized
      given today's tight association of the Web to the Web Browser.

      Conclusion</h2>
      <div id='text-16' class='outline-text-2'>
      <p>
      In 1996, I wrote an article entitled
      <a
      
      
      href='http://www.drdobbs.com/user-interface-a-means-to-an-end/184410453'>User
      Interface — A Means To An End</a> pointing out that the size
      and
      shape of computers were determined by the keyboard and
      display. This is even more true in today's world of tablets,
      phablets and large-sized phones — with the only difference that
      the keyboard has been replaced by a touch screen. The next
      generation in the evolution of <b>personal</b> devices
      is      that they
      will become truly personal by being wearables — this once again
      forces a separation of the user interface peripherals from the
      underlying compute engine. Imagine a variety of wearables that
      collectively connect to ones cell phone, which itself connects to
      the cloud for all its computational and information needs. Such
      an environment is rich in possibilities for creating a wide
      variety of user experiences to a single underlying body of
      information; Eyes-Free interfaces as pioneered by systems like
      Emacspeak will come to play an increasingly vital role alongside
      visual interaction when this comes to pass.

      href='http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CompanyMode'>Company</a> — a  flexible <b>complete-anything</b>   extension for Emacs.
      Package <i>company</i> gains much of its flexibility by
      providing an
      extensible framework for both back-ends and front-ends; back-ends
      are responsible for  language-specific support e.g.,
      <b>C++</b> vs
      <b>Emacs Lisp</b>; front-ends can provide different
      <i>visualizations</i>
      of the available completions.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      I started using package <b>company</b> as I taught
      myself to
      program
      in <a href='http://golang.org'>Go</a>  over the

      <p>
      You can turn on <i>company-mode</i> in dividual buffers;
      you
      can also
      turn it on globally. Company comes pre-packaged with backend
      support for many programming languages; for programming in Go, I
      use module <i>company-go</i> in conjunction with the

      Emacspeak loads package <i>emacspeak-company</i>  when
      package<i>company</i> is loaded, and that automatically
      sets
      up the
      <b>Emacspeak</b> front-end.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Once activated, package <i>company</i> shows available
      completions
      where available once you type a prescribed number of
      characters. Available candidates are displayed visually via an
      overlay and can be traversed using either the <span
      class='underline'>up/down</span> arrows or
      keys <span class='underline'>M-n</span> and
      <span
      class='underline'>M-p</span>. You can also search
      and
      filter the
      available completions, see documentation for command
      <span class='underline'>company-mode</span>. The
      available visual front-ends also display
      relevant metadata for the current candidate in the echo
      area.

      <p>
      Front-end <i>emacspeak-company</i> performs the

      <li>Auditory icon <span

      <div id='text-1-2' class='outline-text-3'>
      <p>
      Company uses a fluid visual interface to display completions
      without the user having to switch contexts — it achieves this by
      using overlays that appear briefly in the form of a conceptual
      tooltip. These pseudo tooltips are created and destroyed via a
      timer; keyboard interaction causes thesee to be updated —
      including hiding the tooltip where appropriate.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Module <i>emacspeak-company</i>   speech-enables this
      interface by
      examining the underlying information used to create the
      visualization  to produce an effective audio-formatted
      representation.
      The net effect is that you can write code with completion helping
      you along the way; you do not need  to switch tasks to lookup
      details  as to what completions are available.

      Liberty, Equality And Freedom:</h3> 
      <div id='text-1-4' class='outline-text-3'> 
      <p> 
      Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all 
      major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular, 
      distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated 
      system without any undue pressure—a documented success for 
      the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system 
      evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at 
      the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak 
      codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform 
      used to develop and distribute the software. 
      </p> 
      
      <p> 
      Extensive studies have shown that thanks to thesee features, users 
      consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this 
      wide-spread user demand, the present version remains   priceless 
      as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as 
      previous releases. 
      </p> 
      
      <p> 
      At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of 
      eyes-free social interaction and carries forward the 
      well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user 
      interface features that eventually show up in luser environments. 
      </p> 
      
      <p> 
      On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a 
      crash-prone but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion 
      "Emacs is a system from the 70's", the creator of
      Emacspeak
      evinced surprise at the unusual candor manifest in the
      assertion 
      that it would take popular idiot-proven interfaces until the year 
      2070 to catch up to where the Emacspeak audio desktop is 
      today. Industry experts welcomed this refreshing breath of 
      Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time when users are 
      reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) unleashed by 
      complex software systems backed by even more convoluted press 
      releases.

      Test      Results:</h3> 
      <div id='text-1-5' class='outline-text-3'> 
      <p> 
      Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and 
      not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without
            adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer.
      These 
      same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped 
      functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of
            Emacspeak once pointed out that thesee results re-emphasize the
            user-centric design of Emacspeak; "It is the user –and
      not the 
      computer– that stops functioning when Emacspeak is
      uninstalled!".

            to the resilliance and innovation embodied by Open Source

      that continues to ensure that Emacs remains one of the premier 
      user environments despite perhaps also being one of the 
      oldest. Emacspeak 28.0—AKA PuppyDog—exemplifies the rapid pace
      of 
      development evinced by Open Source software. Emacspeak 27.0—AKA 
      FastDog—is the latest in a sequence of upgrades that make

      inherent 
      in traditional adaptive technologies. Emacspeak 25 —AKA ActiveDog 
      —re-activates open, unfettered access to online 
      information. Emacspeak-Alive —AKA LiveDog —enlivens open,

      productivity by exploiting today's evolving WWW 
      standards. Emacspeak-16.0 –code named CleverDog– the follow-up

      TopDog as the next in a continuing a series of award-winning 
      audio desktop releases from Emacspeak Inc. Emacspeak-14.0 –code

      millennium. Emacspeak-13.0 –codenamed YellowLab– was the 
      closing release of the 20th. century. Emacspeak-12.0 –code named 
      GoldenDog– began leveraging the evolving semantic WWW to provide 
      task-oriented speech access to Webformation. Emacspeak-11.0 
      –code named Aster– went the final step in making Linux a 
      zero-cost Internet access solution for blind and visually 
      impaired users. Emacspeak-10.0 –(AKA Emacspeak-2000) code named 
      WonderDog– continued the tradition of award-winning software 
      releases designed to make eyes-free computing a productive and 
      pleasurable experience. Emacspeak-9.0 –(AKA Emacspeak 99) code 
      named BlackLab– continued to innovate in the areas of speech 
      interaction and interactive accessibility. Emacspeak-8.0 –(AKA 
      Emacspeak-98++) code named BlackDog– was a major upgrade to the 
      speech output extension to Emacs. 
      </p> 
      
      <p> 
      Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois) was released as OpenSource on 
      the Internet in May 1995 as the first complete speech interface 
      to UNIX workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96 (code 
      named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant 
      enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went 
      further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98 
      integrated Internetworking into all aspects of the audio desktop 
      to provide the first fully interactive speech-enabled WebTop.

      href='http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2013/11/reading-web-content-efficiently.html'>EWW</a> has become my preferred way of consuming

      Module Emacspeak-Webspace provides a rolling ticker of 
      information  that is automatically retrieved, cached and 
      maintained by Emacspeak.  Using this functionality, you can set 
      up specific buffers to have <i>interesting</i> tidbits
      of      information 
      displayed automatically in the header-line; Emacspeak speaks 
      thesee items of information as you switch contexts. This article 
      explains the usage model and underlying  design of Emacspeak 
      Webspaces.

      Background</h3> 
      <div class='outline-text-3' id='text-1-1'> 
      <p> 
      The Emacspeak Webspace module was originally created in early 
      <a
      
      
      href='http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2008/03/emacspeak-webspace-interaction-free.html'>Interaction 
      Free Information Access (2008)</a> 
      because I wanted the audio equivalent of being able to 
      quickly <i>glance</i> at information.  Here are some
      aspects
      of visual 
      interaction that I wanted to emulate: 
      </p> 
      <ul class='org-ul'> 
      <li>You can quickly glance at something while switching
      contexts, 
      and ignore it if it is not important. 
      </li> 
      <li>The object that you <i>glance</i> at while
      switching contexts does 
      not become an object of attention ie, the casual task remains 
      casual, as opposed to becoming the primary task.  Email is 
      the antitheseis to this model — where if you start glancing 
      at email, it's a sufficiently strong distraction that you'll
            start doing email  — as opposed to what you were supposed 
      to be doing. 
      </li> 
      <li>If the item you glanced at deserves further attention, you
            can come back to it later — and the system gives you 
      sufficient confidence in your ability to come back to it 
      later — note that this is <b>essential</b> to ensure
      the 
      previous  requirement. 
      </li> 
      <li>Items  are cached  but get pushed out by newer items —
      this 
      makes sure you dont feel pressured to <i>read
      everything</i>
      or 
      have to explicitly <i>catch-up</i> — in prior systems
      including 
      email and Google Reader, I always found the task of hitting 
      <i>catch-up</i> without reading everything  a fairly
      stressful experience. 
      </li> 
      <li>Applied to information updates, think <i>hallway
      conversations</i> 
      outside your office — you mostly ignore them, but sometime 
      get drawn because you hear some specific keywords and/or 
      concepts that draw your attention.

      Implementation
      In 2009</h3> 
      <div class='outline-text-3' id='text-1-2'> 
      <p> 
      I used the WebSpace functionality in Emacspeak for news and 
      weather updates starting 2009; at some time in late 2009, I cut 
      it over to get updates from my Google Reader stream.  It was 
      extremely effective for my usage pattern — I typically 
      activated the functionality in all shell buffers. In my work 
      style where I switch among the primary tasks of engineering 
      (writing/reviewing  code), writing/reviewing design documents, 
      and doing email to facilitate the previous two tasks, the shell 
      buffer is where I switch to while context-switching e.g., 
      launching a build after writing code as an example.  Having the 
      Webspace functionality say <i>something interesting</i>
      at
      those times 
      was optimal.

      Implementation And Design</h3> 
      <div class='outline-text-3' id='text-1-3'> 
      <p> 
      The information to be pulled in the rolling header line is pulled 
      from a cache — in 2009, this cache was populated from my Google 
      Reader stream. The cache was maintained in a ring with older 
      items falling off the end.  You could optionally switch to a 
      buffer displaying all of the currently cached items — this 
      functionality assured me that  I could always later find an item 
      that  had caught my attention while  I was in the process of 
      context switching amongst tasks. Notice that if I didn't go back
            and check for that item within a day, it would fall off the 
      ring-buffer cache — and this usually would mean that it likely 
      wasn't't that important after all.

      Google
      Reader</h3> 
      <div class='outline-text-3' id='text-1-4'> 
      <p> 
      With the passing of Google Reader last year, I started 
      implementing the feed-reading functionality I needed in Emacspeak 
      independent of Google Reader; see the earlier article in this 
      blog titled <a
      
      
      href='http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2013/12/managing-and-accessing-feeds-on.html'>Managing And Accessing Feeds On The Emacspeak Audio 
      Desktop</a>. 
      Next, I updated the Emacspeak WebSpace functionality to build its 
      cache from the set of feeds in <span
      
      
      class='underline'>emacspeak<sub>feeds</sub></span>.

      class='section-number-3'>1.5</span> Usage
      Pattern</h3> 
      <div class='outline-text-3' id='text-1-5'> 
      <p> 
      This section details my own usage pattern and set-up — this is 
      by no means the only way to use this functionality. 
      </p> 
      <ol class='org-ol'> 
      <li>Emacspeak binds Webspace functionality to  <span
      class='underline'>Hyper Space</span>  as 
      a prefix key. 
      </li> 
      <li><span class='underline'>Hyper Space
      h</span> invokes command 
      <span
      
      class='underline'>emacspeak-webspace-headlines</span> 
      — this command 
      initializes the feed-store cache, and sets up the 
      header-line in the current buffer to display a rolling 
      ticker.  Note that you can invoke this command in multiple 
      buffers;  those buffers will share a common headlines cache. 
      </li> 
      <li>The feed-store is updated during Emacs idle-time; I often 
      invoke  the elisp form 
      <span
      
      
      class='underline'>(emacspeak-webspace-headlines-populate)</span> to populate the 
      cache initially. Note that depending on your network, and 
      the number of feeds you have in <span
      class='underline'>emacspeak-feeds</span>, this can 
      block emacs for a couple of minutes. 
      </li> 
      <li>Command <span
      
      
      class='underline'>emacspeak-webspace-headlines-browse</span>  displays an 
      interactive buffer containing the current set  of cached 
      headlines — this is where you go to track down a headline 
      you heard in passing. I bind this to <span
      class='underline'>Super h</span> by 
      customizing <span
      class='underline'>emacspeak-super-keys</span>. 
      </li> 
      <li>You can set up other types of information in your rolling 
      header — something I initially used it for was weather 
      — see command  <span
      class='underline'>emacspeak-webspace-weather</span>
       
      personally, 
      I 've not found this as useful in CA given how consistently 
      good the weather is here. 
      </li> 
      <li>For related work in Emacs, see Emacs package <span
      class='underline'>newsticker</span>. 
      That package works well with Emacspeak, but in using it 
      earlier, I found that I could not prevent myself from 
      starting to read content i.e., it failed to meet the 
      <i>glance and continue</i> requirement.

      <div id='text-1' class='outline-text-2'>
      <p>
      Emacs package GNUS provides a very efficient interface for
      consuming large amounts of email.
      You can access GMail using GNUS' IMap interface, for my own
      configuration for doing this, see file <span
      class='underline'>tvr/gnus-prepare.el</span> in
      the Emacspeak SVN  repository.
      Module <span class='underline'>gm-nnir.el</span>
       in
      package <span class='underline'>g-client</span>
      implements some
      convenience hooks to enable efficient searching of GMail. Module
      <span class='underline'>emacspeak-gnus</span>
      has      been updated to bind commands from module
      <span class='underline'>gm-nnir.el</span> to
      <span

      <div id='text-1-1' class='outline-text-3'>
      <p>
      Assuming you already have GNUS configured to read GMail via IMap,
      you can:
      </p>
      
      <ul class='org-ul'>
      <li>Press <span class='underline'>/</span>
      in
      the  groups buffer  to search your mail. This
      command accepts all GMail queries, so for example,
      </li>
      </ul>
      <pre class='example'>
      after: 2014/02/01 to: me
      </pre>
      <p>
      Will find all messages received after   February 1, 2014 and
      addressed to you.
      </p>
      <pre class='example'>
      label: foo after: 2014/01/01
      </pre>
      <p>
      Will find messages with label <span
      class='underline'>foo</span> and received after
      January
      1, 2014.
      </p>
      <ul class='org-ul'>
      <li>Press <span class='underline'>?</span>
      in
      the Group buffer to execute a more extensive
      search command; this accepts both IMap query specifications
      (per RFC 3501) as well as GMail query specifications. The

      The BBC offers a wealth of audio content from both domestic BBC
      Radio as well as BBC World Service.
      Much of this content is available as Podcasts for a week after it
      has been broadcast; in some instances, content is archived and
      available for more than a week.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
      The  primary gateway to this content is BBC IPlayer. In
      addition, one can subscribe to RSS feeds for BBC Podcasts.

      Here are some of the tools I  use on the Emacspeak desktop to
      quickly find and access content from the BBC:
      </p>
      
      <ul class='org-ul'>
      <li>The BBC publishes a continuously updated directory of 
      RSS feeds; Emacspeak url template  <b>BBC Podcast
      Directory</b>
      can be used to open this directory of feeds.
      </li>
      <li>With the above directory of feeds at hand, it is easy to
      subscribe to oft-accessed feeds via
      <b>emacspeak-feeds</b>
      — see

      </li>
      <li>In addition to the directory of feeds covered above, the
      BBC
      publishes a detailed program guide as XML; Emacspeak url
      template <b>BBC  Program Guide</b> accesses the program
      guide.</li>
      <li>The program guide described above gives access to RSS
      feeds      for both current programs as 
      </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      well as past archives. The program guide is a wealth of
      information that makes all the information available in one
      location, unlike the BBC IPlayer site.
      </p>
      <ul class='org-ul'>
      <li>A note for UK users; the program guide above is presently
      set
      up to  only show content that is available world-wide; if
      you're in the UK, you may want to remove the test for

      in the XSL  stylesheet  emacspeak/xsl/bbc-ppg.xsl.

      <ul class='org-ul'>
      <li>You can find the <a

      Feature <b>emacspeak-feeds</b> enables rapid access to
      managing and
      accessing Atom, RSS and OPML feeds. Feeds can be browsed from a
      dedicated buffer, or accessed via minibuffer completion for
      oft-accessed feeds. Feeds are stored as a user customizable
      option, and can be added and deleted either via Emacs' customize
      interface or directly via interactive Emacs commands.

      <div id='text-1-2' class='outline-text-3'>
      <p>
      The list of subscribed feeds is stored in variable
      <span class='underline'>emacspeak-feeds</span>
      which
      is managed via Emacs' <span
      class='underline'>customize</span>
      interface. Each entry this list contains a label for the feed,
      the feed URL, and the type of the feed (<sub>rss</sub>_,
      <span class='underline'>atom</span>, or
      <span class='underline'>opml</span>).

      <p>
      Interactive command  <span
      
      class='underline'>emacspeak-webspace-feed-reader</span>
      opens a
      buffer containing the list of subscribed feeds; feeds can be
      opened by pressing <span
      class='underline'>enter</span> on the relevant
      feed. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Oft-accessed feeds can be opened directly via command
      <span
      class='underline'>emacspeak-feed-browse</span>
      bound to <span class='underline'>C-e C-u</span>
      —
      this command prompts
      for a feed label with minibuffer completion.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Feeds can be added or deleted by customizing <span
      class='underline'>emacspeak-feeds</span>
      via Emacs' <span class='underline'>M-x
      customize-variable</span> — bound by default in
      emacspeak to <span class='underline'>C-h

      Alternatively, interactive command
      <span
      class='underline'>emacspeak-feed-add-feed</span>
      bound
      to <span class='underline'>C-e M-u</span> can be
      used
      to
      subscribe to feeds. Note that both methods result in the

      I still find reading Web content in emacs to be way more
      efficient than in modern browsers like Chrome with ChromeVox
      enabled.
      Chrome+ChromeVox is what I use for rich Web Applications;
      but when it comes down to reading straight content ranging from
      technical documentation to news and current affairs, I find that
      I can read a lot more content in a fixed amount of time with
      Emacs+Emacspeak than I can with the Chrome+ChromeVox combination.

      <div id='text-1-2' class='outline-text-3'>
      
      
      <p>
      The author of GNUS recently added package 
      EWW (Emacs Web Wowser) to The Emacs repository  — 
      see his
      <a
      
      
      href='http://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/2013/06/eww.html'>announcement</a>.
      Emacspeak 37.0 included a small addition called
      <i>shr-url</i> that
      leveraged his earlier <i>shr</i> package; I've now
      added
      support for
      EWW in the Emacspeak source tree. Note that EWW is in the Emacs
      source tree, i.e. it will be part of Emacs 24.4, but you can use
      it now if you build your own version of Emacs, or obtain an
      Emacs that is build from the Emacs source repository.
      </p>
      <p>
      EWW and SHR are interesting because they both leverage
      <i>libxml2</i> to parse the incoming HTML. This is way
      faster
      than
      the native elisp browsing used in Emacs/W3. In my personal
      opinion, it also opens up more possibilities than Emacs/W3M with
      respect to manipulating and filtering content from elisp ---
      something that helps create a better reading experience when
      using Emacspeak.

      <p>
      I've mailed out a small patch to package <i>eww</i>
      that
      facilitates
      implementing such higher-level commands; for now, you can find
      that patch in <span
      
      
      style='text-decoration:underline;'>emacspeak/lisp/patches</span> in the Emacspeak svn
      repository. With that patch in place, you can do the following to
      efficiently filter popular news sites such as the New York Times
      (I use <a
      
      
      href='http://mobile.nytimes.com'>http://mobile.nytimes.com</a>) or CNN
      (<a href='http://cnn.com'>http://cnn.com</a>).

      NASDOG: ESPK has now been consistently trading over

      <p>Emacspeak is a fully functional audio desktop that provides
      complete eyes-free access to all major 32 and 64 bit operating
      environments. By seamlessly blending live access to all aspects
      of the Internet such as Web-surfing, blogging, social computing
      and electronic messaging into the audio desktop, Emacspeak
      enables speech access to local and remote information with a
      consistent and well-integrated user interface. A rich suite of
      task-oriented tools provides efficient speech-enabled access to
      the evolving service-oriented social Web cloud.

      Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all
      major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,
      distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated
      system without any undue pressure—a documented success for
      the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system
      evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at
      the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak
      codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform
      used to develop and distribute the software.
      </p>
      <p>
      Extensive studies have shown that thanks to thesee features, users
      consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this
      wide-spread user demand, the present version remains priceless
      as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as
      previous releases.
      </p>
      <p>
      At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of
      eyes-free social interaction and carries forward the
      well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user
      interface features that eventually show up in luser environments.
      </p>
      <p>
      On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a
      crash-prone but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion
      "Emacs is a system from the 70's", the creator of
      Emacspeak
      evinced surprise at the unusual candor manifest in the assertion
      that it would take popular idiot-proven interfaces until the year
      2070 to catch up to where the Emacspeak audio desktop is
      today. Industry experts welcomed this refreshing breath of
      Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time when users are
      reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) unleashed by
      complex software systems backed by even more convoluted press
      releases.

      <p>
      Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and
      not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without
      adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer. These
      same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped
      functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of
      Emacspeak once pointed out that thesee results re-emphasize the
      user-centric design of Emacspeak; "It is the user  – and not
      the
      computer –  that stops functioning when Emacspeak is
      uninstalled!".</p>

      desktop with many new tools including full EPub support  —  hence
      the name EPubDog. Emacspeak 35.0 is all about teaching a new dog
      old tricks  —  and is aptly code-named HeadDog in honor of our

      software—it would not exist without the thriving Emacs community
      that continues to ensure that Emacs remains one of the premier
      user environments despite perhaps also being one of the
      oldest. Emacspeak 28.0—AKA PuppyDog—exemplifies the rapid pace
      of      development evinced by Open Source software. Emacspeak
      27.0—AKA
      FastDog—is the latest in a sequence of upgrades that make
      previous releases obsolete and downgrades unnecessary. Emacspeak

      access solutions that are unfettered by the constraints inherent
      in traditional adaptive technologies. Emacspeak 25 —AKA ActiveDog
      —re-activates open, unfettered access to online
      information. Emacspeak-Alive —AKA LiveDog —enlivens open,

      enhance user productivity at work and leisure. Emacspeak-18.0

      ownership. Emacspeak-17.0  – code named HappyDog –  enhances
      user      productivity by exploiting today's evolving WWW
      standards. Emacspeak-16.0  – code named CleverDog –  the
      follow-up
      to SmartDog –  continued the tradition of working better, faster,
      smarter. Emacspeak-15.0  – code named SmartDog – followed up on
      TopDog as the next in a continuing a series of award-winning
      audio desktop releases from Emacspeak Inc. Emacspeak-14.0  – code

      millennium. Emacspeak-13.0  – codenamed YellowLab –  was the
      closing release of the 20th. century. Emacspeak-12.0  – code named
      GoldenDog –  began leveraging the evolving semantic WWW to provide
      task-oriented speech access to Webformation. Emacspeak-11.0
      – code named Aster –  went the final step in making Linux a
      zero-cost Internet access solution for blind and visually
      impaired users. Emacspeak-10.0  – (AKA Emacspeak-2000) code named
      WonderDog –  continued the tradition of award-winning software
      releases designed to make eyes-free computing a productive and
      pleasurable experience. Emacspeak-9.0  – (AKA Emacspeak 99) code
      named BlackLab –  continued to innovate in the areas of speech
      interaction and interactive accessibility. Emacspeak-8.0  – (AKA
      Emacspeak-98++) code named BlackDog –  was a major upgrade to the
      speech output extension to Emacs.
      </p>
      <p>
      Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois) was released as OpenSource on
      the Internet in May 1995 as the first complete speech interface
      to UNIX workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96 (code
      named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant
      enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went
      further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98
      integrated Internetworking into all aspects of the audio desktop
      to provide the first fully interactive speech-enabled WebTop.

      <p> 
      Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all 
      major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular, 
      distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated 
      system without any undue pressure—a documented success for 
      the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system 
      evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at 
      the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak 
      codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform 
      used to develop and distribute the software. 
      </p> 
      <p> 
      Extensive studies have shown that thanks to thesee features, users 
      consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this 
      wide-spread user demand, the present version remains   priceless 
      as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as 
      previous releases. 
      </p> 
      <p> 
      At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of 
      eyes-free social interaction and carries forward the 
      well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user 
      interface features that eventually show up in luser environments. 
      </p> 
      <p> 
      On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a 
      crash-prone but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion 
      "Emacs is a system from the 70's", the creator of
      Emacspeak
      evinced surprise at the unusual candor manifest in the
      assertion 
      that it would take popular idiot-proven interfaces until the year 
      2070 to catch up to where the Emacspeak audio desktop is 
      today. Industry experts welcomed this refreshing breath of 
      Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time when users are 
      reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) unleashed by 
      complex software systems backed by even more convoluted press 
      releases.

      <p> 
      Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and 
      not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without
            adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer.
      These 
      same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped 
      functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of
            Emacspeak once pointed out that thesee results re-emphasize the
            user-centric design of Emacspeak; "It is the user –and
      not the 
      computer– that stops functioning when Emacspeak is
      uninstalled!".

      Emacspeak 38.0 is the latest in a series of award-winning 
      releases from Emacspeak Inc.  
      Emacspeak 37.0 continues the tradition of delivering robust 
      software as reflected by its code-name. Emacspeak 36.0 enhances 
      the audio desktop with many new tools including full EPub support 
      — hence the name EPubDog. Emacspeak 35.0 is all about teaching 
      a new dog old tricks — and is aptly code-named HeadDog in honor 
      of our new Press/Analyst contact. emacspeak-34.0 (AKA Bubbles) 
      established a new beach-head with respect to rapid task 
      completion in an eyes-free environment. Emacspeak-33.0 AKA

      SocialDog brings the Social Web to the audio desktop—you can't but 
      be social if you speak! Emacspeak 29.0—AKAAbleDog—is a testament
            to the resilliance and innovation embodied by Open Source 
      software—it would not exist without the thriving Emacs community 
      that continues to ensure that Emacs remains one of the premier 
      user environments despite perhaps also being one of the 
      oldest. Emacspeak 28.0—AKA PuppyDog—exemplifies the rapid pace
      of 
      development evinced by Open Source software. Emacspeak 27.0—AKA 
      FastDog—is the latest in a sequence of upgrades that make 
      previous releases obsolete and downgrades unnecessary. Emacspeak 
      26—AKA LeadDog—continues the tradition of introducing innovative
            access solutions that are unfettered by the constraints
      inherent 
      in traditional adaptive technologies. Emacspeak 25 —AKA ActiveDog 
      —re-activates open, unfettered access to online 
      information. Emacspeak-Alive —AKA LiveDog —enlivens open,

      tradition of relying on enhanced productivity to liberate 
      users. Emacspeak-20.0 —AKA LeapDog —continues the long 
      established GNU/Emacs tradition of integrated innovation to 
      create a pleasurable computing environment for eyes-free 
      interaction. emacspeak-19.0 –AKA WorkDog– is designed to 
      enhance user productivity at work and leisure. Emacspeak-18.0 
      –code named GoodDog– continued the Emacspeak tradition of 
      enhancing user productivity and thereby reducing total cost of 
      ownership. Emacspeak-17.0 –code named HappyDog– enhances user 
      productivity by exploiting today's evolving WWW 
      standards. Emacspeak-16.0 –code named CleverDog– the follow-up 
      to SmartDog– continued the tradition of working better, faster, 
      smarter. Emacspeak-15.0 –code named SmartDog–followed up on 
      TopDog as the next in a continuing a series of award-winning 
      audio desktop releases from Emacspeak Inc. Emacspeak-14.0 –code 
      named TopDog–was the first release of this 
      millennium. Emacspeak-13.0 –codenamed YellowLab– was the 
      closing release of the 20th. century. Emacspeak-12.0 –code named 
      GoldenDog– began leveraging the evolving semantic WWW to provide 
      task-oriented speech access to Webformation. Emacspeak-11.0 
      –code named Aster– went the final step in making Linux a 
      zero-cost Internet access solution for blind and visually 
      impaired users. Emacspeak-10.0 –(AKA Emacspeak-2000) code named 
      WonderDog– continued the tradition of award-winning software 
      releases designed to make eyes-free computing a productive and 
      pleasurable experience. Emacspeak-9.0 –(AKA Emacspeak 99) code 
      named BlackLab– continued to innovate in the areas of speech 
      interaction and interactive accessibility. Emacspeak-8.0 –(AKA 
      Emacspeak-98++) code named BlackDog– was a major upgrade to the 
      speech output extension to Emacs. 
      </p> 
      <p> 
      Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois) was released as OpenSource on 
      the Internet in May 1995 as the first complete speech interface 
      to UNIX workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96 (code 
      named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant 
      enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went 
      further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98 
      integrated Internetworking into all aspects of the audio desktop 
      to provide the first fully interactive speech-enabled WebTop.

      Run command M-x gmaps to bring up the maps interaction buffer. 
      This buffer provides many special commands for talking to Google 
      Maps –  use <span
      style='text-decoration:underline;'>C-h
      b</span> in emacs to get a list of 
      key-bindings. Here is a brief summary of how things work: 
      </p> 
      <ul> 
      <li>You can get directions (walking, driving, by cycling, or 
      public transit)  via keystrokes <span
      style='text-decoration:underline;'>w</span>,
      <span
      style='text-decoration:underline;'>d</span>,
      <span
      style='text-decoration:underline;'>b</span>, or
      <span
      style='text-decoration:underline;'>t</span>. These 
      commands prompt for start and end addresses. 
      </li> 
      <li>You can set your current location  by hitting <span
      style='text-decoration:underline;'>c</span>  — ;
      this 
      will be used for Places Search. 
      </li> 
      <li>You can specify the radius for Places Search by pressing
      <span
      style='text-decoration:underline;'>r</span> 
      and specifying the radius  e.g. <i>500</i> for 500m. 
      </li> 
      <li>You can set up an optional  filter for your Places Search
      by
      pressing <span
      style='text-decoration:underline;'>f</span>. 
      </li> 
      <li>Pressing <span
      style='text-decoration:underline;'>n</span> at this
      point will show you places in your 
      vicinity that match your filter criteria. 
      </li> 
      <li>Pressing 'space' on a Place displays details for
      that
      place. 
      </li> 
      <li>Place details when expanded provide buttons that link you
      to

      Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all
      major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,
      distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated
      system without any undue pressure—a documented success for
      the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system
      evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at
      the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak
      codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform
      used to develop and distribute the software.
      </p>
      <p>
      Extensive studies have shown that thanks to thesee features, users
      consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this
      wide-spread user demand, the present version remains   priceless
      as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as
      previous releases.
      </p>
      <p>
      At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of
      eyes-free social interaction and carries forward the
      well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user
      interface features that eventually show up in luser environments.
      </p>
      <p>
      On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a
      crash-prone but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion
      "Emacs is a system from the 70's", the creator of
      Emacspeak
      evinced surprise at the unusual candor manifest in the assertion
      that it would take popular idiot-proven interfaces until the year
      2070 to catch up to where the Emacspeak audio desktop is
      today. Industry experts welcomed this refreshing breath of
      Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time when users are
      reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) unleashed by
      complex software systems backed by even more convoluted press
      releases.

      <p>
      Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and
      not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without
      adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer. These
      same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped
      functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of
      Emacspeak once pointed out that thesee results re-emphasize the
      user-centric design of Emacspeak; "It is the user –and not
      the      computer– that stops functioning when Emacspeak is
      uninstalled!".

      <p>Emacspeak 37.0 continues the tradition of delivering robust
      software as reflected by its code-name. Emacspeak 36.0 enhances
      the audio desktop with many new tools including full EPub support
      — hence the name EPubDog. Emacspeak 35.0 is all about teaching
      a new dog old tricks — and is aptly code-named HeadDog in honor
      of our new Press/Analyst contact. emacspeak-34.0 (AKA Bubbles)
      established a new beach-head with respect to rapid task
      completion in an eyes-free environment. Emacspeak-33.0 AKA
      StarDog brings unparalleled cloud access to the audio
      desktop. Emacspeak 32.0 AKA LuckyDog continues to innovate via
      open technologies for better access. Emacspeak 31.0 AKA TweetDog
      — adds tweeting to the Emacspeak desktop. Emacspeak 30.0 AKA
      SocialDog brings the Social Web to the audio desktop—you can't but
      be social if you speak! Emacspeak 29.0—AKAAbleDog—is a testament
      to the resilliance and innovation embodied by Open Source
      software—it would not exist without the thriving Emacs community
      that continues to ensure that Emacs remains one of the premier
      user environments despite perhaps also being one of the
      oldest. Emacspeak 28.0—AKA PuppyDog—exemplifies the rapid pace
      of      development evinced by Open Source software. Emacspeak
      27.0—AKA
      FastDog—is the latest in a sequence of upgrades that make
      previous releases obsolete and downgrades unnecessary. Emacspeak
      26—AKA LeadDog—continues the tradition of introducing innovative
      access solutions that are unfettered by the constraints inherent
      in traditional adaptive technologies. Emacspeak 25 —AKA ActiveDog
      —re-activates open, unfettered access to online
      information. Emacspeak-Alive —AKA LiveDog —enlivens open,
      unfettered information access with a series of live updates that
      once again demonstrate the power and agility of open source
      software development. Emacspeak 23.0 – AKA Retriever—went the
      extra mile in fetching full access. Emacspeak 22.0 —AKA GuideDog
      —helps users navigate the Web more effectively than ever
      before. Emacspeak 21.0 —AKA PlayDog —continued the Emacspeak
      tradition of relying on enhanced productivity to liberate
      users. Emacspeak-20.0 —AKA LeapDog —continues the long
      established GNU/Emacs tradition of integrated innovation to
      create a pleasurable computing environment for eyes-free
      interaction. emacspeak-19.0 –AKA WorkDog– is designed to
      enhance user productivity at work and leisure. Emacspeak-18.0
      –code named GoodDog– continued the Emacspeak tradition of
      enhancing user productivity and thereby reducing total cost of
      ownership. Emacspeak-17.0 –code named HappyDog– enhances user
      productivity by exploiting today's evolving WWW
      standards. Emacspeak-16.0 –code named CleverDog– the follow-up
      to SmartDog– continued the tradition of working better, faster,
      smarter. Emacspeak-15.0 –code named SmartDog–followed up on
      TopDog as the next in a continuing a series of award-winning
      audio desktop releases from Emacspeak Inc. Emacspeak-14.0 –code
      named TopDog–was the first release of this
      millennium. Emacspeak-13.0 –codenamed YellowLab– was the
      closing release of the 20th. century. Emacspeak-12.0 –code named
      GoldenDog– began leveraging the evolving semantic WWW to provide
      task-oriented speech access to Webformation. Emacspeak-11.0
      –code named Aster– went the final step in making Linux a
      zero-cost Internet access solution for blind and visually
      impaired users. Emacspeak-10.0 –(AKA Emacspeak-2000) code named
      WonderDog– continued the tradition of award-winning software
      releases designed to make eyes-free computing a productive and
      pleasurable experience. Emacspeak-9.0 –(AKA Emacspeak 99) code
      named BlackLab– continued to innovate in the areas of speech
      interaction and interactive accessibility. Emacspeak-8.0 –(AKA
      Emacspeak-98++) code named BlackDog– was a major upgrade to the
      speech output extension to Emacs.
      </p>
      <p>
      Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois) was released as OpenSource on
      the Internet in May 1995 as the first complete speech interface
      to UNIX workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96 (code
      named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant
      enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went
      further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98
      integrated Internetworking into all aspects of the audio desktop
      to provide the first fully interactive speech-enabled WebTop.

      NASDOG: ESPK has now been consistently trading over   
      the net at levels close to that once attained by DogCom   
      high-fliers—and as of October 2009 is trading at levels close to  
            that achieved by once better known stocks in the tech sector.

      Emacspeak is a fully functional audio desktop that provides   
      complete eyes-free access to all major 32 and 64 bit operating   
      environments. By seamlessly blending live access to all aspects   
      of the Internet such as Web-surfing, blogging, social computing   
      and electronic messaging into the audio desktop, Emacspeak   
      enables speech access to local and remote information with a   
      consistent and well-integrated user interface. A rich suite of   
      task-oriented tools provides efficient speech-enabled access to   
      the evolving service-oriented social Web cloud.

      <p>   
      Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all   
      major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,   
      distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated   
      system without any undue pressure—a documented success for   
      the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system   
      evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at   
      the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak   
      codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform   
      used to develop and distribute the software.   
      </p>   
      <p>   
      Extensive studies have shown that thanks to thesee features, users   
      consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this   
      wide-spread user demand, the present version remains   priceless   
      as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as   
      previous releases.   
      </p>   
      <p>   
      At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of   
      eyes-free social interaction and carries forward the   
      well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user   
      interface features that eventually show up in luser environments.   
      </p>   
      <p>   
      On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a   
      crash-prone but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion   
      "Emacs is a system from the 70's", the creator of
      Emacspeak
      
      evinced surprise at the unusual candor manifest in the assertion   
      that it would take popular idiot-proven interfaces until the year   
      2070 to catch up to where the Emacspeak audio desktop is   
      today. Industry experts welcomed this refreshing breath of   
      Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time when users are   
      reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) unleashed by   
      complex software systems backed by even more convoluted press   
      releases.

      <div class='outline-text-3' id='text-1-6'>   
      <p>   
      Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and   
      not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without
        
      adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer. These
        
      same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped   
      functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of
        
      Emacspeak once pointed out that thesee results re-emphasize the   
      user-centric design of Emacspeak; "It is the user —and not
      the   
      computer— that stops functioning when Emacspeak is
      uninstalled!".

      Emacspeak 36.0 enhances the audio desktop with many new tools   
      including full EPub support — hence the name EPubDog. Emacspeak   
      35.0 is all about teaching a new dog old tricks — and is aptly   
      code-named HeadDog in honor of our new Press/Analyst   
      contact. emacspeak-34.0 (AKA Bubbles) established a new   
      beach-head with respect to rapid task completion in an eyes-free   
      environment. Emacspeak-33.0 AKA StarDog brings unparalleled cloud   
      access to the audio desktop. Emacspeak 32.0 AKA LuckyDog   
      continues to innovate via open technologies for better   
      access. Emacspeak 31.0 AKA TweetDog — adds tweeting to the   
      Emacspeak desktop. Emacspeak 30.0 AKA SocialDog brings the Social   
      Web to the audio desktop—you can't but be social if you speak!   
      Emacspeak 29.0—AKAAbleDog—is a testament to the resilliance and 
       
      innovation embodied by Open Source software—it would not exist   
      without the thriving Emacs community that continues to ensure   
      that Emacs remains one of the premier user environments despite   
      perhaps also being one of the oldest. Emacspeak 28.0—AKA   
      PuppyDog—exemplifies the rapid pace of development evinced by   
      Open Source software. Emacspeak 27.0—AKA FastDog—is the latest
      in   
      a sequence of upgrades that make previous releases obsolete and   
      downgrades unnecessary. Emacspeak 26—AKA LeadDog—continues the  
            tradition of introducing innovative access solutions that are 
       
      unfettered by the constraints inherent in traditional adaptive   
      technologies. Emacspeak 25 —AKA ActiveDog —re-activates open,   
      unfettered access to online information. Emacspeak-Alive —AKA   
      LiveDog —enlivens open, unfettered information access with a   
      series of live updates that once again demonstrate the power and   
      agility of open source software development. Emacspeak 23.0 --   
      AKA Retriever—went the extra mile in fetching full   
      access. Emacspeak 22.0 —AKA GuideDog —helps users navigate the  
            Web more effectively than ever before. Emacspeak 21.0 —AKA  
            PlayDog —continued the Emacspeak tradition of relying on
      enhanced   
      productivity to liberate users. Emacspeak-20.0 —AKA LeapDog   
      —continues the long established GNU/Emacs tradition of integrated 
       
      innovation to create a pleasurable computing environment for   
      eyes-free interaction. emacspeak-19.0 —AKA WorkDog— is designed 
       
      to enhance user productivity at work and leisure. Emacspeak-18.0   
      —code named GoodDog— continued the Emacspeak tradition of   
      enhancing user productivity and thereby reducing total cost of   
      ownership. Emacspeak-17.0 —code named HappyDog— enhances user   
      productivity by exploiting today's evolving WWW   
      standards. Emacspeak-16.0 —code named CleverDog— the follow-up  
            to SmartDog— continued the tradition of working better,
      faster,   
      smarter. Emacspeak-15.0 —code named SmartDog—followed up on   
      TopDog as the next in a continuing a series of award-winning   
      audio desktop releases from Emacspeak Inc. Emacspeak-14.0 —code   
      named TopDog—was the first release of this   
      millennium. Emacspeak-13.0 —codenamed YellowLab— was the   
      closing release of the 20th. century. Emacspeak-12.0 —code named  
            GoldenDog— began leveraging the evolving semantic WWW to
      provide   
      task-oriented speech access to Webformation. Emacspeak-11.0   
      —code named Aster— went the final step in making Linux a   
      zero-cost Internet access solution for blind and visually   
      impaired users. Emacspeak-10.0 —(AKA Emacspeak-2000) code named   
      WonderDog— continued the tradition of award-winning software   
      releases designed to make eyes-free computing a productive and   
      pleasurable experience. Emacspeak-9.0 —(AKA Emacspeak 99) code   
      named BlackLab— continued to innovate in the areas of speech   
      interaction and interactive accessibility. Emacspeak-8.0 —(AKA   
      Emacspeak-98++) code named BlackDog— was a major upgrade to the   
      speech output extension to Emacs.   
      </p>   
      <p>   
      Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois) was released as OpenSource on   
      the Internet in May 1995 as the first complete speech interface   
      to UNIX workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96 (code   
      named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant   
      enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went   
      further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98   
      integrated Internetworking into all aspects of the audio desktop   
      to provide the first fully interactive speech-enabled WebTop.

      <p>
      Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all
      major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,
      distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated
      system without any undue pressure—a documented success for
      the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system
      evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at
      the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak
      codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform
      used to develop and distribute the software.
      </p>
      <p>
      Extensive studies have shown that thanks to thesee features, users
      consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this
      wide-spread user demand, the present version remains   priceless
      as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as
      previous releases.
      </p>
      <p>
      At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of
      eyes-free social interaction and carries forward the
      well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user
      interface features that eventually show up in luser environments.
      </p>
      <p>
      On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a
      crash-prone but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion
      "Emacs is a system from the 70's", the creator of
      Emacspeak
      evinced surprise at the unusual candor manifest in the assertion
      that it would take popular idiot-proven interfaces until the year
      2070 to catch up to where the Emacspeak audio desktop is
      today. Industry experts welcomed this refreshing breath of
      Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time when users are
      reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) unleashed by
      complex software systems backed by even more convoluted press
      releases.

      <p>
      Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and
      not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without
      adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer. These
      same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped
      functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of
      Emacspeak once pointed out that thesee results re-emphasize the
      user-centric design of Emacspeak; "It is the user –and not
      the      computer– that stops functioning when Emacspeak is
      uninstalled!".

      <p>Emacspeak 35.0 is all about teaching a new dog old tricks
      —
      andis aptly code-named HeadDog in honor of our new Press/Analyst
      contact. emacspeak-34.0 (AKA Bubbles) established a new
      beach-head with respect to rapid task completion in an eyes-free
      environment. Emacspeak-33.0 AKA StarDog brings unparalleled cloud
      access to the audio desktop. Emacspeak 32.0 AKA LuckyDog
      continues to innovate via open technologies for better
      access. Emacspeak 31.0 AKA TweetDog — adds tweeting to the
      Emacspeak desktop. Emacspeak 30.0 AKA SocialDog brings the Social
      Web to the audio desktop—you can't but be social if you speak!
      Emacspeak 29.0—AKAAbleDog—is a testament to the resilliance and
      innovation embodied by Open Source software—it would not exist
      without the thriving Emacs community that continues to ensure
      that Emacs remains one of the premier user environments despite
      perhaps also being one of the oldest. Emacspeak 28.0—AKA
      PuppyDog—exemplifies the rapid pace of development evinced by
      Open Source software. Emacspeak 27.0—AKA FastDog—is the latest
      in      a sequence of upgrades that make previous releases obsolete
      and
      downgrades unnecessary. Emacspeak 26—AKA LeadDog—continues the
      tradition of introducing innovative access solutions that are
      unfettered by the constraints inherent in traditional adaptive
      technologies. Emacspeak 25 —AKA ActiveDog —re-activates open,
      unfettered access to online information. Emacspeak-Alive —AKA
      LiveDog —enlivens open, unfettered information access with a
      series of live updates that once again demonstrate the power and
      agility of open source software development. Emacspeak 23.0 --
      AKA Retriever—went the extra mile in fetching full
      access. Emacspeak 22.0 —AKA GuideDog —helps users navigate the
      Web more effectively than ever before. Emacspeak 21.0 —AKA
      PlayDog —continued the Emacspeak tradition of relying on enhanced
      productivity to liberate users. Emacspeak-20.0 —AKA LeapDog
      —continues the long established GNU/Emacs tradition of integrated
      innovation to create a pleasurable computing environment for
      eyes-free interaction. emacspeak-19.0 –AKA WorkDog– is designed
      to enhance user productivity at work and leisure. Emacspeak-18.0
      –code named GoodDog– continued the Emacspeak tradition of
      enhancing user productivity and thereby reducing total cost of
      ownership. Emacspeak-17.0 –code named HappyDog– enhances user
      productivity by exploiting today's evolving WWW
      standards. Emacspeak-16.0 –code named CleverDog– the follow-up
      to SmartDog– continued the tradition of working better, faster,
      smarter. Emacspeak-15.0 –code named SmartDog–followed up on
      TopDog as the next in a continuing a series of award-winning
      audio desktop releases from Emacspeak Inc. Emacspeak-14.0 –code
      named TopDog–was the first release of this
      millennium. Emacspeak-13.0 –codenamed YellowLab– was the
      closing release of the 20th. century. Emacspeak-12.0 –code named
      HeadDog– began leveraging the evolving semantic WWW to provide
      task-oriented speech access to Webformation. Emacspeak-11.0
      –code named Aster– went the final step in making Linux a
      zero-cost Internet access solution for blind and visually
      impaired users. Emacspeak-10.0 –(AKA Emacspeak-2000) code named
      WonderDog– continued the tradition of award-winning software
      releases designed to make eyes-free computing a productive and
      pleasurable experience. Emacspeak-9.0 –(AKA Emacspeak 99) code
      named BlackLab– continued to innovate in the areas of speech
      interaction and interactive accessibility. Emacspeak-8.0 –(AKA
      Emacspeak-98++) code named BlackDog– was a major upgrade to the
      speech output extension to Emacs.
      </p>
      <p>
      Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois) was released as OpenSource on
      the Internet in May 1995 as the first complete speech interface
      to UNIX workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96 (code
      named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant
      enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went
      further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98
      integrated Internetworking into all aspects of the audio desktop
      to provide the first fully interactive speech-enabled WebTop.

      Tilden Labrador, a young, energetic male  yellow Labrador, has
      accepted the position of Press/Analyst contact for Emacspeak
      Inc.   ---  in addition to his primary   responsibility of being
      a  fulltime guide-dog.<br />
      Hand-picked from an exclusive pool of high-quality caninedates,
      Tilden
      brings
      a large and level head to this  position of
      responsibility. Tilden grew up in Monroe Ct,  before going to
      school at Guiding Eyes For The Blind (GEB), NY.
      He graduated from GEB's Action program after excelling at
      obstacle avoidance and path planning in Yorktown Heights,
      peekskill and White Plains. He rounded out his education with a
      one-week practicum  on the Google campus in Mountain View CA.<br
      />
      Tilden brings a fresh perspective to his new job --- he is the
      first male Labrador to  take on the role of Emacspeak Inc.'s
      press/analyst contact. Asked how he felt about this unique
      distinction, he pointed out:<br />
      "On the Internet no one knows you're a dog, leave alone
      what      gender you are".<br />

      of the Internet such as Web-surfing, blogging, social computing
      and electronic messaging into the audio desktop, Emacspeak
      enables speech access to local and remote information with a
      consistent and well-integrated user interface. A rich suite of
      task-oriented tools provides efficient speech-enabled access to
      the evolving service-oriented social Web cloud.

      Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all
      major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,
      distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated
      system without any undue pressure—a documented success for
      the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system
      evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at
      the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak
      codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform
      used to develop and distribute the software.
      </p>
      <p>
      Extensive studies have shown that thanks to thesee features, users
      consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this
      wide-spread user demand, the present version remains   priceless
      as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as
      previous releases.
      </p>
      <p>
      At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of
      eyes-free social interaction and carries forward the
      well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user
      interface features that eventually show up in luser environments.
      </p>
      <p>
      On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a
      crash-prone but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion
      "Emacs is a system from the 70's", the creator of
      Emacspeak
      evinced surprise at the unusual candor manifest in the assertion
      that it would take popular idiot-proven interfaces until the year
      2070 to catch up to where the Emacspeak audio desktop is
      today. Industry experts welcomed this refreshing breath of
      Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time when users are
      reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) unleashed by
      complex software systems backed by even more convoluted press
      releases.

      <p>
      Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and
      not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without
      adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer. These
      same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped
      functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of
      Emacspeak once pointed out that thesee results re-emphasize the
      user-centric design of Emacspeak; "It is the user –and not
      the      computer– that stops functioning when Emacspeak is
      uninstalled!".

      SocialDog brings the Social Web to the audio desktop—you can't
      but be social if you speak! Emacspeak 29.0—AKAAbleDog—is
      a testament to the resilliance and innovation embodied by Open
      Source software—it would not exist without the thriving Emacs
      community that continues to ensure that Emacs remains one of the
      premier user environments despite perhaps also being one of the
      oldest. Emacspeak 28.0—AKA PuppyDog—exemplifies the rapid
      pace of development evinced by Open Source software. Emacspeak
      27.0—AKA FastDog—is the latest in a sequence of upgrades
      that make previous releases obsolete and downgrades
      unnecessary. Emacspeak 26—AKA LeadDog—continues the
      tradition of introducing innovative access solutions that are

      SmartDog–followed up on TopDog as the next in a continuing a
      series of award-winning audio desktop releases from Emacspeak
      Inc. Emacspeak-14.0 –code named TopDog–was the first release of
      this millennium. Emacspeak-13.0 –codenamed YellowLab– was the
      closing release of the 20th. century. Emacspeak-12.0 –code named
      GoldenDog– began leveraging the evolving semantic WWW to provide
      task-oriented speech access to Webformation. Emacspeak-11.0
      –code named Aster– went the final step in making Linux a
      zero-cost Internet access solution for blind and visually
      impaired users. Emacspeak-10.0 –(AKA Emacspeak-2000) code named
      WonderDog– continued the tradition of award-winning software
      releases designed to make eyes-free computing a productive and
      pleasurable experience. Emacspeak-9.0 –(AKA Emacspeak 99) code
      named BlackLab– continued to innovate in the areas of speech
      interaction and interactive accessibility. Emacspeak-8.0 –(AKA
      Emacspeak-98++) code named BlackDog– was a major upgrade to the
      speech output extension to Emacs.
      </p>
      <p>
      Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois) was released as OpenSource on
      the Internet in May 1995 as the first complete speech interface
      to UNIX workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96 (code
      named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant
      enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went
      further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98
      integrated Internetworking into all aspects of the audio desktop
      to provide the first fully interactive speech-enabled WebTop.

      fully accessible using either Emacs/W3 or Emacs/W3M from within

    <h2><a name="idm1293" id="idm1293">Silence
      Is Golden
    </a></h2>
<div>
<br>   
      <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>   
      <p>Speech is silvern --- but silence is golden!   
      In the spirit of the above, I just added command   
      <code>emacspeak-silence</code> to Emacspeak. You can
      bind      this   
      command to your favorite key for silencing all audio output on   
      the complete audio desktop --- including any active media   
      streams.</p>   
      <h2>What This Does</h2>   
      
      <p>Command <code>emacspeak-silence</code> stops
      speech
      by calling   
      <code>dtk-stop</code>. It then runs commands placed on  
            <code>emacspeak-silence-hook</code>.   
      Each media player defined by Emacspeak  updates hook   
      <code>emacspeak-silence-hook</code> with an appropriate
      action   
      that pauses or resumes  that player.</p>   
      
      <p>I've also updated the keymaps in   
      <code>tvr/console-keymaps</code> to set up the   
      <code>windows</code> key on the console to produce   
      <code>[silence]</code>, and bound command   
      <code>emacspeak-silence</code> to
      <code>[silence]</code> in   
      <code>emacspeak-keymap.el</code>.</p>   
      
      <p>   
      The net effect is that if you use those console maps, you can   
      just hit the <code>windows</code> key whenever you want
      to   
      silence all audio output; pressing it again will resume any media   
      streams you had active.</p>   
      
      <p>Share And Enjoy --- and here's  wishing our
      Press/Analyst   
      contact a very Happy 13th Birthday --- mark it with a palindromic   
      moment at  <code>010212212010</code>   
      i.e., <code>Tue Dec 21 01:02:15 PST 2010</code>

      <p> 
      Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all 
      major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular, 
      distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated 
      system without any undue pressure  ---  a documented success for 
      the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system 
      evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at 
      the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak 
      codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform 
      used to develop and distribute the software. 
      </p> 
      <p> 
      Extensive studies have shown that thanks to thesee features, users 
      consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this 
      wide-spread user demand, the present version remains   priceless 
      as ever  ---  it is being made available at the same zero-cost as 
      previous releases. 
      </p> 
      <p> 
      At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of 
      eyes-free social interaction and carries forward the 
      well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user 
      interface features that eventually show up in luser environments. 
      </p> 
      <p> 
      On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a 
      crash-prone but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion 
      "Emacs is a system from the 70's", the creator of
      Emacspeak
      evinced surprise at the unusual candor manifest in the assertion 
      that it would take popular idiot-proven interfaces until the year 
      2070 to catch up to where the Emacspeak audio desktop is 
      today. Industry experts welcomed this refreshing breath of 
      Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time when users are 
      reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) unleashed by 
      complex software systems backed by even more convoluted press 
      releases.

      <p> 
      Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and 
      not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without
            adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer.
      These 
      same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped 
      functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of
            Emacspeak once pointed out that thesee results re-emphasize the
            user-centric design of Emacspeak; "It is the user  -- and
      not the 
      computer --  that stops functioning when Emacspeak is
      uninstalled!".

      speech output extension to Emacs. 
      </p> 
      <p> 
      Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois) was released as OpenSource on 
      the Internet in May 1995 as the first complete speech interface 
      to UNIX workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96 (code 
      named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant 
      enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went 
      further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98 
      integrated Internetworking into all aspects of the audio desktop 
      to provide the first fully interactive speech-enabled WebTop.

      <p>
      Emacspeak is a fully functional audio desktop that provides
      complete eyes-free access to all major 32 and 64 bit operating
      environments. By seamlessly blending live access to all aspects
      of the Internet such as Web-surfing, blogging, social computing
      and electronic messaging into the audio desktop, Emacspeak
      enables speech access to local and remote information with a
      consistent and well-integrated user interface. A rich suite of
      task-oriented tools provides efficient speech-enabled access to
      the evolving service-oriented Web cloud.

      <p>
      Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all
      major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,
      distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated
      system without any undue pressure  ---  a documented success for
      the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system
      evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at
      the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak
      codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform
      used to develop and distribute the software.
      </p>
      <p>
      Extensive studies have shown that thanks to thesee features, users
      consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this
      wide-spread user demand, the present version remains   priceless
      as ever  ---  it is being made available at the same zero-cost as
      previous releases.
      </p>
      <p>
      At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of
      eyes-free social interaction and carries forward the
      well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user
      interface features that eventually show up in luser environments.
      </p>
      <p>
      On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a
      crash-prone but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion
      "Emacs is a system from the 70's", the creator of
      Emacspeak
      evinced surprise at the unusual candor manifest in the assertion
      that it would take popular idiot-proven interfaces until the year
      2070 to catch up to where the Emacspeak audio desktop is
      today. Industry experts welcomed this refreshing breath of
      Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time when users are
      reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) unleashed by
      complex software systems backed by even more convoluted press
      releases.

      <p>
      Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and
      not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without
      adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer. These
      same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped
      functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of
      Emacspeak once pointed out that thesee results re-emphasize the
      user-centric design of Emacspeak; "It is the user  -- ;and not
      the

      <p>Almost exactly 16 years to the date after presenting AsTeR
      --- <a
      
      
      href='http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/aster/aster-toplevel.html'>Audio System For Technical Readings</a> --- 
      to the CS Faculty at Cornell for my <a
      
      
      href='http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/phd-theseis/index.html'>PhD</a>, I released the source
      code as Open Source --- thanks to Prof. David Gries at Cornell
      for approving this release.</p>
      <p>The sources are checked into GoogleCode project 
      <a
      
      href='http://aster-math.googlecode.com'>aster-math</a>
      ---
      unfortunately, the name AsTeR was unavailable since there is an
      unrelated project of the same name at SourceForge.</p>
      <p>So you might well ask: why 16 years later, and why now? The
      honest answer is <q>No good reason,</q> except that
      after      graduating from Cornell, I decided that I would work on 
      newer
      projects, and consequently had no cycles to support the AsTeR
      code base. Nothing has changed in that context, nor is it likely
      to change in the coming future; however I get requests off and on
      from different parts of the Web from teachers and students alike
      who have seen my PhD  theseis, played with the demos, and wish to
      study the sources.</p>
      <h2>What You'll Find In The Sources</h2>
      <p>The code has not been actively developed since I finished
      my      work at Cornell; however, over the years, I 've ensured
      that the
      system starts up and runs on Linux using the Open Source CLisp
      environment.
      The only text-to-speech engine that is supported is the hardware
      DECTalk  --- though it should be a small matter of programming to
      support the various Emacspeak speech servers. If you do checkout
      the source code, start by looking at the 
      <a
      
      
      href='http://aster-math.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/README'>README</a>
      file which contains brief instructions on getting started. Feel
      free to use the Emacspeak mailing list for now if you wish to
      discuss the code --- if the traffic justifies it, we can later
      create a project-specific list.</p>

    </a></h2>
<div>

      <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
      <p>Emacspeak has supported  the  editing  of Unicode text for
      over a year now --- thanks to the patches fromLukas.
      With the support now mature, I have now retired option
      <code>emacspeak-unibyte</code> --- Emacspeak no longer
      supports
      running Emacs in <code>unibyte</code> mode. Note that
      this
      aligns
      Emacspeak with Emacs 23.2 which obsoletes
      <code>unibyte</code>mode.</p>
      
      <p>When you edit text containing Unicode  characters,  
      Emacspeak uses the name of  the character as found in the
      description file from the Unicode consortium --- you will need to
      download and install that data file as documented in
      Emacs:</p>      <pre>
      describe-char-unicodedata-file is a variable defined in
      `descr-text.el'.
      Its value is 
      "/usr/local/share/unicode/UnicodeData.txt"
      
      Documentation:
      Location of Unicode data file.
      This is the UnicodeData.txt file from the Unicode Consortium, used
      for
      diagnostics.  If it is non-nil `describe-char' will print data
      looked up from it.  This facility is mostly of use to people doing
      multilingual development.
      
      This is a fairly large file, not typically present on GNU systems.
      At the time of writing it is at the URL
      `http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt'.
      
      You can customize this variable.
      
      This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
      version 22.1 of Emacs.
      
      </pre>
      <p>With the Unicode data file in place, Emacspeak can announce
      names of characters  from <em>all</em> of the
      world's      fonts ---
      this includes Braille.
      As an added convenience, I have integrated package
      <code>toy-braille.el</code> found on the Emacs wiki into
      the
      Emacs codebase and defined a new interactive command
      <code>emacspeak-wizards-braille</code> --- if you find
      yourself
      using it often, you can bind it to a key of your choice.
      Command <code>emacspeak-wizards-braille</code> prompts
      for
      thesetring to Braille and produces a Grade-1 representation of  the
      specified string using the appropriate Unicode characters.

      Emacspeak Servers --- Catching Up With Debian And Ubuntu
    </a></h2>
<div>
<br>
      <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
      <p>Over the last couple of years, the TCL world has moved on
      from
      TCL8.3 to TCL8.4 --- this introduces a set of needed
      changes to how Emacspeak servers such as Espeak and
      ViaVoice-Outloud work.
      I have finally decided to break backward compatibility with
      TCL8.3 and move things forward to TCL8.4, now that all the Linux
      distributions have settled on TCL8.4.</p>
      <p>Also, sometime in 2005, I transitioned all of the server
      Makefiles to use libtool --- at the time, it made compilation of
      the servers somewhat easier.  However, this has tended to make
      things more complex over time, thanks to changes in libtool.
      I've      now dropped the libtool dependency in favor of using
      simpler
      Makefiles --- thanks William Hubbs of Gentoo!</p>
      
      <h3>ViaVoice Outloud Server For Emacspeak</h3>
      <p>The Voxin package from Guilles continues to be the easiest
      means of obtaining high-quality text-to-speech on Linux.
      Installation of that package went smoothly on Hardy; however on
      Jaunty, things did not go so well, see notes below for things to
      watch out for on Jaunty or later.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The libstdc++ compat libraries ended up not getting
      installed
      on Jaunty. Consequence, ViaVoice produces a warning asking you to
      install the ViaVoice RTK, even though it's already installed. I
      ended up rescuing the compat libs from my Hardy build. Perhaps
      we should put up a simple tar.gz file that drops those libs into
      /usr/lib?</li>
      <li>Alsa is configured to use pulseaudio on Jaunty. 
      An unfortunate consequence is that when ViaVoice runs, it sounds
      like a stereo channel played as mono, i.e. the speech slows down
      and the voice sounds wrong. The fix is to create a  .asoundrc  
      file in your home directory --- you can use the sample in
      linux-outloud/ASOUNDRC  as a starting point. To see if
      pulseaudio is intervening in your setup, do
      :aplay -v  wav file 
      --- to see the set of alsa plugins that are participating in
      audio output. </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>ESpeak And Emacspeak</h3>
      
      <p> The ESpeak server does not get affected by the above
      problem. However, unless you install package  alsa-oss 
      and invoke that server as 
      :aoss tcl  espeak 
      the server will fail to start if some other application is using
      the audio device.</p>
      
      <h3>Software Dectalk And Emacspeak</h3>
      
      <p>This still needs testing under newer Linux distributions
      ---      I've not used it in a long time and dont have the libs
      installed
      any more.</p>

      Launching Favorite Media Via Hot Keys
    </a></h2>
<div>
<br>
      <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
      <h2>Launching Oft-Played Media On The Complete Audio
      Desktop</h2>
      <p>Command <code>emacspeak-multimedia</code> lets
      you
      launch all
      forms of local and remote media. However this still requires you
      to specify the media location --- and this requires a bunch of
      keystrokes that you end up repeating for selecting media that you
      play often, e.g., from your private music collection. No more
      extra keystrokes, you can now have Emacspeak automatically assign
      suitable hotkeys for launching
      <code>emacspeak-media</code>
      onyour favorite audio collections.</p>
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Customize Emacspeak option
      <code>emacspeak-media-location-bindings</code> using
      Emacs'
      Custom interface:
      <pre>
      M-x customize-variable --- 
      </pre>
      press <code>C-H V</code> in emacspeak.
      </li>
      <li>Click <code>ins</code> to insert a 
      key/location
      pair. </li>
      <li>Click <code>save</code> to persist the
      binding.</li>
      <li>pressing the assigned hotkey will automatically launch
      <code>emacspeak-multimedia</code> on the predefined
      location
      ---
      emacs will prompt you with regular filename completion for media
      resources found in that directory.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In my own case, I have favorites defined on
      <code>hyper-&lt;n&gt;</code>  so I can define
      up to 10
      hotkey
      assignments  for media  locations.Once launched, Emacspeak
      automatically switches to the media player buffer; note that this
      is different from how <code>emacspeak-multimedia</code>
      normally
      works. The justification: this hotkey interface is 
      ideally suited to remote controls, joysticks, and  any other
      peripheral via which you can deliver input to Emacs. </p>

      Project <a
      
      href='http://eyes-free.googlecode.com'>Eyes-Free</a>      aims to enable fluent eyes-free use of mobile
      devices running Android. Target uses range from eyes-busy
      environments like in-car use to users who are unwilling to or
      incapable of looking at the visual display ---  see  <a

      4, 2009, for a high-level overview. As described in that article,
      we are releasing components from project Eyes-Free as they become
      ready for end-user deployment. This announcement marks the first
      public release of the <i>eyes-free shell</i> on the
      Android
      Marketplace, though the underlying source code has been available
      for some time from the code repository at <a

      Hosting</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      Here is a brief overview of the end-user affordances provided in
      this release:
      </p>
      
      <ol>
      <li>
      An <i>Eyes-Free Shell</i> for conveniently launching
      talking
      applications.
      </li>
      <li>
      A collection of useful talking applications that turn an
      Android phone into an eyes-free communication device  ---  see
      subsequent sections for an overview of thesee
      applications. Note that these eapplications have been written
      to be both useful to end-users as well as to help the
      developer community to come up to speed with developing
      eyes-free applications for Android.
      
      </li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>We will be uploading video tutorials demonstrating the use
      of
      thesee applications to YouTube  ---   please see the project
      Web site for thesee links as they become available.

      <p>
      A key innovation is the use of the touch screen to enable
      one-handed, eyes-free dialing of phone numbers using the touch
      screen  ---  see Miguel Helft's NY Times article cited above for
      a
      good
      layman's description of the technique. The talking dialer comes
      with a talking phone-book that enables users to quickly select a
      desired contact using the touch screen.

      href='http://google-axsjax.googlecode.com'>Google-AxsJAX</a> was launched in late 2007 as a library for
      access-enabling Web-2.0 applications. 
      Since then, we have released accessibility enhancements for many
      Web-2.0 applications via the AxsJAX site as early experiments
      that have eventually graduated into the products being extended.
      Today, we are happy to announce an early AxsJAX  extension  for
      Google
      Moderator that enables fluent eyes-free use of Google Moderator
      as seen on the White House site.

      <a
      
      
      href='http://google-axsjax.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/faq.html'>AxsJAX FAQ</a>. Briefly, you need Firefox 3.0 and a screenreader that
      supports W3C ARIA. Users who do not have a screenreader installed
      can most easily experience the results by installing <a
      href='http:///www.clcworld.net'>Fire Vox</a>, a
      freely available self-voicing extension for Firefox.
      </p>
      <p>
      With the AxsJAX extension in place, you can use Google Moderator
      via the keyboard, with all user interaction producing spoken
      feedback via W3C ARIA. Here is a brief overview of  the user
      experience:
      </p>
      <ol>
      <li>
      The user interface is divided into  logical panes ---  one
      listing topic areas, and the other listing questions in a
      given topic. At times, e.g., before a meeting, you may find
      an additional <i>Featured Question</i> pane that shows a
      randomly
      selected question that you can vote on.
      </li>
      <li>
      Users can ask new questions under a given topic, or  give a
      thumbs-up/down to questions that have already been asked.
      </li>
      <li>
      Use the <u>left</u> and <u>right</u> arrow
      keys
      to switch between the two
      panes. You hear the  title of  the selected pane as
      you switch.
      </li>
      <li>
      Use <u>up</u> and <u>down</u> arrows to
      navigate
      among the items in
      the selected pane. As you navigate, you hear the current
      item.
      </li>
      <li>
      Hit <u>enter</u> to select the current item.
      </li>
      <li>
      The current item can be magnified by repeated presses of the
      <u>+</u> (or <u>=</u>) key. To reduce
      magnification, press the <u>-</u>
      key.
      </li>
      <li>
      When navigating the questions in a given topic, hit
      <u>y</u>
      or
      <u>n</u> to vote a question up or down.
      </li>
      <li>
      When navigating items in the topic pane, hit <u>a</u> to
      ask
      aquestion. Once you confirm your request to post the
      question, it will show up in the list of questions for that
      topic so that others can vote that question up or down.

      <p>Module <code>emacspeak-webspace</code> has a
      few new
      goodies
      on offer.
      If you activate <em>WebSpace Headlines </em> to obtain a
      continuously updating ticker of headlines, you may also at times  
      want to  find one of the headlines you heard go by and
      read the relevant article. 
      Command  <code>emacspeak-webspace-headlines-view</code>
      bound
      by
      default to <code>C-RET</code> pops up a special
      <em>Headlines</em> buffer that lists all the currently
      available
      headlines. This is a regular Emacs buffer that uses a special 
      major mode called  <em>emacspeak-webspace-mode</em>.
      This      modeprovides special commands to open a feed  at point,
      follow
      hyperlinks etc.; use Emacs' online help facilities to learn how
      this buffer works.</p>
      <p>Mode <em>emacspeak-webspace-mode</em> is also
      used
      toadvantage in browsing information retrieved via the Google AJAX
      APIs described  in the previous set of articles on this blog.
      Google Reader subscribers can now view the subscription list in a
      <em>Webspace</em> buffer via command
      <code>emacspeak-webspace-reader</code>.
      Additionally, command <em>emacspeak-webspace-google</em>
      provides
      a more convenient interface to command
      <code>gweb-google-at-point</code> --- in addition to
      speaking
      the
      snippet from the first search hit, this command places the first
      four results in a special <em>Search Results</em> buffer
            that is put in <em>Webspace</em> mode.</p>
      <strong>Search And Enjoy!</strong>

      <h2>In Praise Of The Google AJAX Search API</h2>
      <p>Emacspeak has always provided Google Search with a single
      keystroke from anywhere on the audio desktop.
      But with the 
      coming of the <a
      href='http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/'>Google
      AJAX      Search API </a>
      it becomes possible to integrate Google Search at a far deeper
      level into your fingertips!
      The AJAX  API demonstrates the true speed of Google Search, since
      you dont need to wait for an HTML page to download and render ---
      results are served as a light-weight 
      <a href='http://json.org/'>JSON</a> data
      structure.</p>
      
      <h2>What You Can Now Do</h2>
      
      <p>
      Module <code>gsearch</code> (part of the
      <code>g-client</code>
      package)
      provides an interactive command
      <code>gsearch-google-at-point</code> --- I have this
      bound to
      key
      <code>hyper-/</code> in Emacs.
      Executing this command from anywhere inside Emacs does the
      following:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Grabs word under point, and prompts in the minibuffer for
      a      search-term --- with the word we just grabbed as the
      default.</li>
      <li>Fetches other relevant search terms in the background via
      Google Suggest, and makes thesee available via Emacs' minibuffer
      history mechanism. Use keys <code>M-n</code> and
      <code>M-p</code>
      to cycle through thesee if needed.</li>
      <li>Hitting <code>ENTER</code> performs a Google
      Search
      using the
      AJAX API, and displays the  title and content snippet for the
      first search result.</li>
      <li>Executing command
      <code>gsearch-google-at-point</code>
      subsequently at the same location opens the first search
      result.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>
      Google is the Web's premier creator of user-friendly Web 2.0
      applications, and I have long viewed it as part of our mission to
      do for users in the long tail (AKA users with special needs) what
      we've achieved for the mainstream user.
      <a
      
      
      href='http://www.abilitynet.org.uk/accessibility2/'>Accessibility 2.0</a> is now a hot topic on the Web
      --- and we would like to move from  a world where AJAX
      applications were a straight No-No with respect to blind users to
      a world where thesee same technologies are used to enhance their
      usability for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
      <a
      
      href='http://code.google.com/p/axsjax'>Google-AxsJAX</a>
      is an Open Source framework for injecting
      accessibility for users with special needs --- and more
      generally, usability enhancements --- into Web 2.0 applications.
      In this TechTalk, Charles Chen and I  
      give a hands-on tutorial on using AxsJAX to enhance the usability
      of Web 2.0  applications. The tutorial  covers the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      A brief introduction to the additional <i>opcodes</i>
      introduced
      by W3C ARIA  to the assembly language of the Web (AKA
      HTML+JavaScript).
      </li>
      <li>
      AxsJAX library abstractions built on the above that  help Web
      developers generate relevant feedback via the user's adaptive
      technology of choice.
      </li>
      <li>
      Steps in creating fluent eyes-free interaction to Web
      applications, including enabling rapid access to parts of a
      complex Web page.
      </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This tutorial focuses on solutions we've already built
      and
      deployed both within shipping products and as early end-user
      experiments. Google products that we will cover include:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      Google WebSearch
      </li>
      <li>
      Google Reader
      </li>
      <li>
      Google Books
      </li>
      <li>
      GMail and Google Talk
      </li>
      <li>
      Google Scholar
      </li>
      <li>
      Google Sky
      </li>
      </ul>
      <p>And time permitting, we might even demonstrate how I now
      make up
      for all the time I save thanks to   an efficient
      eyes-free auditory user interface by playing JawBreaker and
      reading XKCD via their AxsJAXed versions. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Note that writing AxsJAX enhancements to Web applications can
      help you win <a
      
      
      href='/home/build/google3/javascript/axsjax/THANKS.html'>bragging rights and cool swag</a>! The goal of this
      hands-on tutorial is to help you get there faster!

      A Speech-Enabled Task Manager For Emacs
    </a></h2>
<div>
<br>
      <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
      <p>For the last 10 years or so,
      <em>view-process-mode</em>
      has been my task manager of choice for monitoring and controlling
      the state of processes on the Emacspeak audio desktop.
      As of Emacs 23, AKA Emacs from CVS, that module does not work
      anymore --- in fact it has not been updated for several years.
      On the positive side, Emacs now bundles   <em>module
      ProcEd</em>
      --- a task manager that  does for processes what module
      <em>DirEd</em> does for files and directories.
      As of this morning, <em>proced.el</em> is fully
      speech-enabled by
      Emacspeak.
      You can install module <em>ProcEd</em> for Emacs 22 by
      obtaining
      the file from the Web ---
      you can easily find it

      HTML DOM+ JavaScript constitutes the assembly language of Web
      Applications. Access To Rich Internet Applications --- ARIA --- adds
      in a
      couple of additional op-codes for helping Web applications better
      communicate with adaptive technologies such as screenreaders. How do
      we
      now push the envelope with respect
      to Web applications and adaptive technologies such as screenreaders
      and
      self-voicing browsers in a manner similar to what we as Web
      developers
      have collectively achieved for the mainstream user?
      
      This session will demonstrate programming techniques that help Web
      developers experiment with and build in the latest accessibility
      techniques into their Web applications. We will base this session on
      project Google-AxsJAX.
      
      Developers should know JavaScript, but session doesn't require
      deep
      AJAX hackery.</p>

      Emacspeak On Thinkpad X-61 Running Gutsy (Ubuntu 7.0)
    </a></h2>
<div>
<br>
      <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
      <p>I recently upgraded to a Thinkpad X-61 running Gutsy --- 
      here  are some brief notes on the move. In summary, all is well,
      and I like Gutsy running on the X-61.</p>
      <p>Here are things to be aware of both from a hardware and
      software perspective. All of this is with X and GNOME  turned
      off; note that some of the tips e.g. turning off the display  as
      described here, will cause havoc with X.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The X-61 display can be turned off using
      <code>vbetool</code> <br/>
      <pre>vbetool dpms off</pre><br/>
      for turning off the display, and <br/>
      <pre>vbetool dpms on</pre><br/>
      for turning it back on again.</li>
      <li>If you suspend to memory etc., make sure to add the
      appropriate <code>vbetool</code> command to the relevant
      script
      in <code>/etc/acpi/resume.d</code>.</li>
      <li>Gutsy is running ALSA 1.0.15, and to date, I've not
      had any
      trouble with the ViaVoice Outloud TTS  engine in this
      environment.
      Make sure to play with <code>amixer</code>
      --specifically run
      command <br/>
      <pre>amixer controls</pre><br/>
      to understand all the various switches and controls exposed by
      the audio hardware on the X61. 
      Here are some of the things that were noticeably different that
      are worth mentioning:
      <ol>
      <li>The PC  speaker can now be manipulated via
      ALSA.</li>      <li>The X-61 has two input sources. If
      you plug in an external
      mike, make sure to set <em>both</em> input sources   to
      the
      microphone --- as opposed to leaving one or both of them to be
      either <code>internal mic</code> or
      <code>mix</code>. Specifically, plugging in an external
      mike
      <em>does not</em> disable the internal
      microphone.</li>
      <li>For some bizarre reason, it's possible to turn off the
      headphone output--- but you cannot control its gain.</li>
      </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Kernels later than 2.6.21 do much better with respect to
      power management, and this really shows on the X-61. With the LCD
      off, my X61 claims it'll run for 7.5 hours; if you turn off the
      wireless and USB1.1 as well, it claims it can go for over 8.5
      hours.</li>
      <li>Emacs versions: I'm running out of CVS  AKA Emacs
      23--- but
      the <code>emacs-snapshot</code> or
      <code>emacs22</code> Ubuntu
      packages appear to mostly work as well.
      One irritation with some of the prepackaged  bundles of Emacs
      under Ubuntu is that they dont install the Emacs Lisp sources,
      and this will bite if you try compiling packages like
      Emacs/W3.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>All in all, the upgrade to Gutsy was mostly painless ---
      other
      than having to figure out the usual nits about the new hardware.
      The <code>/proc/acpi/ibm</code> support is further along
      but
      not
      yet complete--- as an example <code>/proc/acpi/ibm/video
      </code>
      does not yet control the state of the LCD --- and you cannot
      query the state of the display reliably through that
      interface.</p>

      <h2>Leveraging The Benefits Of Free Speech!</h2>
      <p><strong>For Immediate
      Release:</strong><br/>
      April 1, 2008</p>
      <h2>Live From San Jose ... Emacspeak Goes Social!</h2>
      <p>Investors and users alike welcomed today's announcement
      that
      Emacspeak (NASDOG:ESPK)
      would be going social ---  <em>Going Social is
      better than Going Postal</em>!</p>
      <p>
      As a pioneer in the space of eyes-free information access,
      and a firm believer in free speech and free software,
      Emacspeak will now help users go social speech-free 
      --- all users need do is to use the system. When in use, the
      free-social features of Emacspeak will talk to others on your
      behalf, answer inane questions, and contribute to the community
      by in its turn asking even more inane questions of everyone
      else. In a repeat of the <em>network effect</em> that
      has led
      to
      the resounding success of systems like the World Wide Web and The
      Blogosphere,
      thesee viral features in Emacspeak are expected to win ones
      running instance many social connections.
      The longer one uses thesee features, the <em>deeper</em>
      one's <em>social graph</em>
      --- going forward,  the information encapsulated in thesee social
      graphs will be converted to ever-increasing stacks of small
      pieces of green paper.</p>
      <h2>Coming Soon!</h2> <p>As thesee features are
      launched
      over the
      next few weeks, expect Emacspeak generated conversation streams
      to show up everywhere ranging from <a
      href='http://www.twitter.com'>Twitter</a> streams
      to      random email
      messages that you can usefully use to forward to spammers. This
      innovative approach to communication finally adds value to spam
      --- and is being hailed as the next biggest business model to hit
      the ether. By making such content available on the Internet, the
      system will foster the long term human goal of organizing and
      searching all the world's ignorance to make it universally
      accessible --- thereby bringing ignorance on par with
      knowledge!</p> </div>

    <h2><a name="idm1671" id="idm1671">
      Emacspeak WebSpace --- Interaction-Free Information Access
    </a></h2>
<div>
<br>
      <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
      <p>A few months ago, I started an Emacspeak module called
      <code>emacspeak-webspace</code> that is now ready for
      wider
      use.
      The goal of this module is to unobtrusively fetch useful
      information from the Web and communicate it at  those times that
      one is context-switching among tasks.
      I gave a talk on user interaction at the last 
      <a href='http://www.think.org'>Hackers
      Conference</a>
      in
      November; in the same session, there was another talk  whose gist
      was a plea for <em>less</em> human-computer interaction
      ---
      motivation: User Interfaces are nice, but wouldn't it be nice if
      one didn't have to <em>explicitly</em> interact with
      the
      machine
      to get  information?
      The speaker coined the term <em>Zen interfaces</em> in
      that
      context, something that stuck in memory long after the talk.
      </p>
      
      <p>I built that thought into module
      <code>emacspeak-webspace</code>.
      Conceptually, it consists of <em>smart fetchers</em>
      that      fetch
      information  asynchronously from the Web, and <em>smart
      displayers</em>
      that communicate this information at
      <em>appropriate</em>      times.
      These are detailed below.
      </p>
      <h3>Fetchers</h3>
      <p>There are two  fetchers  at present:</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Weather</dt>
      <dd>Fetches current weather conditions for your
      location.</dd><dt>News</dt>
      <dd>Fetches headlines from a customizable collection of ATOM
      and
      RSS feeds.</dd>
      </dl>
      
      <p>Note that this module is not intended to be an RSS or ATOM 
      feed-reader; for that, use module <code>greader</code>
      --- an
      API-based Google Reader client that is bundled with
      Emacspeak.</p>
      
      <h3>Communicating Useful Information Usefully</h3>
      <p>With the information in hand, the next question is 
      how does one communicate this information
      <em>usefully</em>, 
      and what does <em>at the appropriate time</em> mean?
      Things
      toavoid:
      </p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Interaction-Free</dt>
      <dd>Do not require explicit user action to hear the
      information.</dd>
      <dt>Avoid Chatter</dt>
      <dd>Avoid creating an auditory user interface that chatters at
      the user all the time.</dd>
      </dl>
      
      <p>These are conflicting constraints. Notice that in a visual
      interface, one can meet the <em>interaction-free</em>
      requirement by displaying the information in a  toolbar or
      sidebar and allow the user to ignore or absorb the information at
      will.</p>
      <p>Emacspeak uses Emacs' <em>header-line</em>
      to
      display the
      continuously updating information.
      This meets the <em>interaction-free</em> requirement.
      The header line updates every time Emacs updates its display, and
      automatically speaking it would produce too much feedback.
      But Emacspeak doesn't automatically speak the header-line; it
      only speaks it when there is a
      <em>context-switch</em>.</p>
      
      <h3>How To Use</h3>
      
      <p>Here is how I am using
      <code>emacspeak-webspace</code> at
      present:</p>
      
      <dl>
      <dt>Weather</dt>
      <dd>Activate weather display in the
      <code>calendar</code> and
      <code>scratch</code> buffers.</dd>
      <dt>News</dt>
      <dd>Activate feed headlines in selected
      <code>shell</code>
      buffers.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>You hear the updated information when switching to buffers
      where the webspace display is active.
      </p>
      <h3>Activating WebSpace Displays</h3>
      <p>Webspace displays are activated via the following commands;
      all Webspace displays will be  placed by default on prefix key
      <code>hyper-space</code></p>
      <ul>
      <li><code>emacspeak-webspace-headlines</code>:
      <code>hyper-space
      h</code></li>
      <li><code>emacspeak-webspace-weather</code>
      <code>hyper-space
      w</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Share And Enjoy, And May The Source Be With You!</p>

    <h2><a name="idm1685" id="idm1685">
      Announcing: The Coming Of Piglets To The Emacspeak Desktop
    </a></h2>
<div>
<br>
      <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
      <p>This is to announce a new emacspeak module called
      <em>Piglets</em> that brings together Emacs and Firefox
      to
      create
      a powerful framework for authoring Web interaction
      wizards.</p>      <h2>Why  Piglets?</h2>
      
      <p>You might well ask <q>Why Piglets?</q>,
      and might conjecture that <em>PIGLETS</em> might stand
      for
      <strong>Powerful Internet Gadgets for a  Light-Weight  Talking
      System</strong>.
      You might conjecture that the Emacspeak mascot likes pig-ears; or
      you might even  think of attributing it to the fact that my
      friend and colleague <a
      href='http://firevox.clcworld.net'>Charles Chen</a>
      and
      creator
      of <em> Fire Vox</em> was born in the year of the pig.
      But you'd be mostly wrong in all of the above.</p>
      <p>Piglets on the Emacspeak desktop are the result of having
      two
      large (and powerful) software pigs connect over a socket. A few
      months ago, I blogged here about <em>MozREPL</em> and
      how it
      allows me to  <a
      
      
      href='http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2007/06/firebox-put-fox-in-box.html'>Put
      The Fox In A Box</a>. Piglets mark the completion of the
      Emacs/Firefox integration that started with Firebox. Once you
      install <a href='http://firevox.clcworld.net'>Fire
      Vox</a>, the
      free self-voicing extension for Firefox, piglets become a
      versatile means to leverage the self-voicing  Fire-Vox/Firefox DOM
      from
      the comfort of
      the emacspeak environment.</p>
      
      <h2>What You Need</h2>
      
      <p>Caveat: <strong>ALL</strong> of this is early
      experimental
      software --- and you'll need to tweak things for your
      environment      to get things working.</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li>A version of Emacspeak from the  subversion
      repository.</li>
      <li>Check the installation of the
      <code>servers/python</code>
      files in your Emacspeak installation.</li>
      <li>Confirm that the <code>HTTP</code> wrapper for
      the
      TTS
      servers works. You can most easily do this by running:
      <pre>
      # Start the HTTPspeech server 
      # from emacspeak/servers/python
      python HTTPSpeaker.py  outloud 2222 &amp;
      # you can replace outloud with dtk-exp
      # but the bindings to other TTS  servers is not defined for now
      # Run wget to test the speech server:
      wget --post-data='speak:hello world' localhost:2222
      </pre>
      If all is well, you should here the TTS engine say <q>Hello
      World</q>
      <p><strong>Do not proceed if the above does not
      work.</strong></p></li>
      <li>Install Fire-Vox and configure it to use the Emacspeak TTS
      server.
      You can do this with ORCA  providing the feedback.
      Alternatively, once you have installed Fire-Vox,  shutdown
      Firefox and then edit your
      <code>~/.mozilla/firefox/default/prefs.js</code>
      <pre>
      user_pref("firevox.LastWorkingTTS", 4);
      </pre>
      </li>
      <li>The above sets up Fire-Vox to use the running HTTP speech
      server you started earlier.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Loading And Running Piglets</h2>
      
      <p>The Piglets framework is implemented in module
      <code>emacspeak-piglets.el</code>. There is a Fire-Vox
      binding in
      module <code>emacspeak-firevox.el</code> and a binding
      to the
      <a
      
      
      href='http://code.google.com/p/google-axsjax'>JawBreaker</a>
      game in <code>emacspeak-jawbreaker.el</code>.
      </p>
      
      <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
      
      <p>When you get the various pieces configured and working,
      here      is how things work:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Piglets place you in a special interaction buffer in
      Emacs.</li>
      <li>Typing keys  in this buffer go to Firefox.</li>
      <li>Control keys send commands to Firefox using
      MozREPL.</li>
      <li>The latter is most useful in conjunction with Web 2.0
      applications that have been <a
      
      
      href='http://code.google.com/p/google-axsjax/'>AxsJAX</a>ed.</li>
      <li>Additional commands give access to FireFox features such
      as      the URL bar. As an example, hit <code>C-w</code>
      and type the phrase you'd like to go into the address bar ---
      either a URL  or a search term. As an example, try typing
      <em>XKCDComic</em>.
      This will automatically do a <em>Google Lucky
      Search</em>      (thanks
      to FireFox magic)
      and open the XKCD site.</li>
      <li>But wait, there's more! Because XKCD has been 
      <a
      
      
      href='http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/12/accessibility-mashups-axsjax-fun-with.html'>AxsJAXed</a>, you
      will hear Fire-Vox automatically speak the comic strip and its
      associated transcript. Hit <code>?</code> in the FireFox
      interaction buffer to hear the available keystrokes for this
      AxsJAXed application; in general, <code>?</code> brings
      up
      keyboard help for AxsJAXed applications.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>ToDos:</h2>
      
      <p>These are some todos that I plan to get to eventually ---
      if      you have coding cycles to contribute, feel free to work on
      thesee.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Create an HTTP  binding to the TTS servers using TCL and
      the
      TCL HTTP libraries. This will eliminate the dependency on the
      Python wrapper I originally wrote for ORCA  in fall 2005.</li>
      <li>Write more  Piglets.</li>
      <li>Make installation and configuration simpler.</li>
      <li>Test installation and configuration of the various
      pieces.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2><a name="idm1699" id="idm1699">Web
      Accessibility And Usability: Coming Back To The Basics
    </a></h2>
<div>
<br>
      <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
      <p>
      The Nielsen Norman Group has made available a detailed report on
      accessibility, which includes the results of several usability
      tests
      --- see <a
      
      href='http://www.nngroup.com/reports/accessibility/'>Going      Beyond
      Alt Text</a>.
      It's a very good read,  and though its conclusions might be
      depressing to people coming to this area from the outside ---
      they should be no surprise to users who have been trying to use
      the Web via spoken output over the last 10 years.
      From the perspective of the Emacspeak user who lives in a
      specialized browsing environment that is optimized for performing
      oft-repeated tasks, there are several interesting take-aways from
      this report:</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li>Though so-called <em>Web Accessibility
      Standards</em> have
      attempted to focus on the behavior observed when using
      screenreaders with mainstream browsers, that thread of work
      appears to be achieving little with respect to the real metric of
      <strong>task completion</strong>.
      As technologists, we would all do well to remember that users
      come to the Web, and Web Access solutions not to <em>use the
      browser</em> but rather to complete one or other
      task.</li>
      <li>As described in <a
      
      
      href='http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/raman/publications/specialized-browsers/specialized-browsers.html'>Specialized
      Browsers</a>
      and <a
      
      
      href='http://www.resourceshelf.com/2007/12/02/webcast-the-web-the-way-you-want-it/'>The
      Web The Way You Want It</a>,
      task-oriented access and specialized user-optimized web tools
      have been around since the inception of the Web.</li>
      <li>Though the Nielsen study asked users to carry out each of
      the
      given tasks by going to a given Web site, it would be interesting
      to see how such tasks work out in the Emacspeak environment.
      It's a given that an emacspeak  user trying to buy a music CD at
        an
      online store   would run into a brick wall fairly quickly (see,
      even online stores are made of brick and mortar;-)).
      However, as an Emacspeak user I'd <em>never do
      that</em>
      I'd
      either go to  Amazon's highly efficient 
      <a href='http://www.amazon.com/access'>Amazon
      Accessible
      Store</a>
      or faster yet, type an appropriate query at Google and click on the
      relevant Ad that sports a <em>Google Checkout</em>
      badge.</li>
      <li>And more interestingly, it would be interesting to carry
      out
      a follow-up user study to compare the rate of task completion as
      well as observed efficiencies/inefficiencies 
      between users of Emacspeak and generic browser/screenreader
      combinations for  tasks such as:
      
      <ol>
      <li>Play NPR news from the last hour.</li>
      <li>Play your local NPR station.</li>
      <li>Play BBC  News from the last hour.</li>
      <li>Skim the top stories from CNN.</li>
      <li>Look up  today's stock market numbers for the major
      indices.</li>
      <li>And items too numerous to enumerate in this
      margin.</li>

      Emacspeak Video Demo: Looking Up The Weather
    </a></h2>
<div>
<br>
      <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
      <p>In the first of a sequence of posts demonstrating live
      emacspeak user interaction,
      I'll give an overview of what it feels like to use
      Emacspeak's
      powerful Web Command Line provided by its rich collection of web
      gadgets made up of <em>search wizards</em> and
      <em>smart url
      templates</em></p>
      <p>Here are a few things to note about this and all the
      subsequent video demos in this series:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>All demos were recorded using
      <em>recordmydesktop</em> on an
      Ubuntu laptop running Linux (Ubuntu Dapper).</li>
      <li>The text-to-speech is  produced by the IBM  ViaVoice
      engine,
      this can now be purchased from a couple of sources in the US and
      Europe.</li>
      <li>All demos are recorded with the speech rate at which I use
      Emacspeak.
      These demos are primarily intended to show the efficiency of the
      environment, and slowing down the speech would detract
      significantly from that goal.</li>
      <li>Frequent users of text-to-speech will still find the
      output      comprehensible. For the rest, you can match it up with
      what you
      see on the screen ;-)</li>
      <li>Careful listeners will notice some jitter/clipping in the
      audio --- this appears to be an artifact of using
      <em>recordmydesktop</em> that I was unable to
      eliminate.</li>
      <li>In each of thesee articles, I'll enumerate the actions
      I      take,
      and their effect. I'll enumerate actual keystrokes, but I
      suggest readers focus more on the atomic commands being executed,
      rather than individual keypresses.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Looking Up The Weather</h3>
      <p>Looking up current weather is a sufficiently common action
      where <em>browsing</em> to a weather site, typing in
      ones      zip-code and reviewing the resulting page is three steps
      too
      many.
      This is also why most modern desktop environments provide
      <em>gadgets</em> that display such live information with
      minimal
      user intervention.
      This first video shows Emacspeak <em>smart url</em>
      <code>RSS
      Weather From Wunderground</code>in action.
      </p>
      <p>Here is the  <a
      
      
      href='http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/videos/rss-weather.ogg'>RSS
      Weather Demo</a>.
      This is an OGG/Theora video and should play with tools like
      <code>mplayer</code>.
      The table below shows  a brief description of each user action
      and its effect.</p>

      <h3>A Transcript Of What You Hear</h3>
      
      <p>Users who could see the video half of this demo but were
      not      frequent text-to-speech users reported that it would be
      useful to
      see a transcript of what is being spoken.
      I'm revising this entry to have an annotated transcript.
      Note that the transcript may not be accurate to the last word,
      since I'm typing it in by hand; however it should give one a
      sense of what information emacspeak chooses to speak.</p>
      <dl>
      <dt id='gadget-prompt'>Access Gadgets</dt>
      <dd>The spoken prompt is
      <em>Resource:</em>.</dd>
      <dt id='pick-gadget'>Pick Gadget</dt>
      <dd>You hear me type <em>RS</em> and then you hear
      Emacspeak
      completing my input to <em>RSSWeather</em>.
      Half way through that utterance, I know it's found the right
      gadget, so I hit enter, and that stops the utterance
      <em>RSSWeather</em> half-way through and speaks the next
      prompt.
      Notice that you also hear auditory icons to indicate that a
      prompt input area just opened.</dd>
      <dt id='location'>Location</dt>
      <dd>With the gadget now selected, you hear the
      <em>City/State</em> prompt generated by the weather
      gadget.
      It also produces a default location of
      <em>CA/San_Jose</em>.
      In the demo, you hear the <em>State/City</em> prompt,
      along
      with
      the default value. I hit enter  midway through that utterance,
      again the speech flushes immediately.
      The gadget  now has enough information to do its work; it pulls
      the RSS feed from Wunderground, converts it to XHTML (using XSLT)
      and displays the page using Emacs/W3. Once displayed, it starts
      speak the forecast you see on the screen.</dd>
      <dt id='forecast'>Forecast</dt>
      <dd>Here is a rough transcript of what you hear  as the
      weather      forecast is spoken. The forecast starts with the words:
      <em>Conditions 73 degrees F Partly cloudy 4:50pm PDT  August
      18  
      ...</em>
      This is  in a lower-pitched (deeper) voice since it  was
      generated from the title of the corresponding RSS item. Emacspeak
      uses Aural CSS to produce such audio formatted information.
      The contents of the item are spoken in the default voice starting
      with the utterance <em>Temperature 73 degrees F 23 degrees C
      ...
      Conditions partly cloudy ...</em>
      When I've  heard enough, I hit <code>q</code> to
      quit.</dd>
      <dt id='quit'>Quit</dt>
      <dd>When I quit the weather gadget, a number of things happen.
      <ul>
      <li>You hear auditory icon <em>close-object</em>
      to      indicate the
      weather forecast being dismissed.</li>
      <li>You hear context information indicating that the Emacs
      <em>shell buffer</em> has now become current.</li>
      <li>For this context information, you hear it speak the
      working      directory of the shell buffer and the word
      <em>shell</em></li>
      </ul>
      </dd>
      </dl>

      Emacspeak And GMail

      href='http://groups.google.com/group/accessible/msg/51153b28f91064bd'>article</a>
      by my Google colleague Srinivas Annam that outlines the
      availability of GMail Filters from the basic HTML interface.
      This was the final piece that remained to convince me to use my
      GMail account for email --- now, keeping the GMail Inbox clean
      and free of clutter 
      has become a snap.</p>
      <p>To go with this, I've added a few smart URL templates
      to      Emacspeak's <em>Web Command Line</em>.
      Once you've signed in, you can use 
      template <code>GMail Search</code>
      to type a search term, and find matching messages.
      Note that GMail uses CSS class <code>msg</code>
      to tag the actual contents of a message. You can use this to
      advantage by hitting <code>e c</code>
      on a message link, and specifying <code>msg</code> as
      the      class
      value to filter the message.</p>
      <p>At some point I'll add a couple of Emacspeak wizards
      for      creating filters; the present HTML interface is still a bit
      too
      click intensive for my liking.
      But cudos to Srinivas for doing the hard work that lets me
      discover the pain points in the HTML interface; until now thesee
      were completely invisible to me since I couldn't  
      use GMail from 
      the Emacspeak environment.</p>
      <p>Emacs/W3 note: Note that signing in to GMail from the main
      GMail screen defeats W3.
      An easy work-around, and something that is more efficient anyway
      is to use 
      the <code>glogin.xml</code> form found in Emacspeak ---
      use
      
      <code>C-e ?/</code> in Emacspeak to pick  that form.
      Once you're signed in to Google, you can:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>Open your <a
      href='http://mail.google.com/mail/h/'>inbox
      </a></li>
      <li>Perform searches to find the message you want</li>

    <h2><a name="idm1811" id="idm1811">AMixer
      And Emacspeak: Controlling The Sound Card
    </a></h2>
<div>
<br>
      <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
      <p>In the days of OSS, Emacspeak had a nice Emacs-interface to
      <code>aumix</code>
      and it is a piece of functionality that I have missed even more
      under ALSA,
      given that one can do many more sophisticated tweaks to one's
      sound-card.
      Tool <code>alsamixer</code> --- a full-screen  terminal
      application is bewillderingly confusing (at least to me),
      and <code>amixer</code> though usable required me to go
      find
      out
      how it worked  each time I needed  to do something new.
      The final straw came last weekend when I tried to record some
      Emacspeak demos using <code>recordmydesktop</code>
      and needed to configure ALSA so that it would capture sound
      directly from the PCM output, rather than the microphone.</p>
      <p>To cut a short story even shorter,
      I ended up writing  an Emacs wrapper around
      <code>amixer</code>
      called  --- well, you guessed it, <code>amixer</code>.
      The code is checked in as 
      <a
      
      
      href='http://emacspeak.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/lisp/amixer.el'>amixer.el</a>.
      The Emacspeak keybinding <code>C-e (</code> formerly
      used to
      manipulate <code>aumix</code> is now ALSA-aware 
      and will intelligently default to using the new
      <code>amixer</code> tool if  
      <code>/usr/bin/amixer</code> is available.

      principles of the Web as embodied by HTTP, URIs and HTML,
      specialized Web browsing is in fact not so specialized after all.

      add your first bookmark using form
      <code>xml-forms/bookmark-add.html</code>.
      Fill out that form, hit submit, and extract the value the
      <code>zx</code> parameter returned by the

      <p>Users running out of SVN will have noticed that the
      emacspeak
      codebase has  seen a significant number of updates over the last
      couple of weeks.
      During this time, I've refactored the Web interaction code in
      Emacspeak  to meet the following goals:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>All Emacspeak Web smarts have now been re-factored to be
      independent of any given Web browser. In practice, this avoids
      code duplication between W3 and W3M support.</li>
      <li>The interface to XSLT has been significantly
      improved.</li>
      <li>When using W3, Emacspeak automatically builds a cache of
      CSS
      <code>classnames</code> and <code>ids</code>
      occurring on the
      page.
      These are then used to provide interactive completion when
      invoking commands 
      <code>emacspeak-extract-by-id</code> (bound to
      <code>e
      i</code>
      in Web pages)
      and <code>emacspeak-we-extract-by-class</code> (bound to
      <code>e
      c</code> in Web pages).</li>
      <li>Module <code>emacspeak-we</code> holds all
      code      related to
      <em>editing</em>
      Web pages before they are displayed.</li>
      <li>Module <code>emacspeak-webutils</code> holds
      all
      Web utility
      code.</li>
      <li>Atom and RSS feeds are now pulled using Emacs-22 built-in
      library <code>url</code>
      rather than via libxslt. This has the advantage that the feeds
      are pulled with any cookies the browser may have set during the
      session.</li>
      <li>All <code>url templates</code>,
      <code>search
      wizards</code>
      and related Web utilities should now be capable of working
      similarly under W3 and W3M.</li>
      <li>Module <code>emacspeak-moz</code> provides a
      basic
      level of
      integration with Firefox --- see my related blog post on 
      <a
      
      
      href='http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2007/06/firebox-put-fox-in-box.html'>FireBox</a>.</li>
      <li>Module <code>emacspeak-w3m</code> still needs
      work
      to take
      advantage of all of thesee changes; I myself do not use W3M much,
      so those updates will happen as and when W3M users contribute the
      necessary time and patches.</li>

      The project put together a set of chapters that focused on

      it focused on <em>code</em>

      engineering, here the goal was to <em>explicitly</em>
      focus on real code and how it could be made beautiful.

      <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
      <p>So I use module <code>greader</code> (part of
      package <a
      
      
      href='http://emacspeak.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/lisp/g-client'>G-Client</a>
      to read a large number of ATOM and RSS feeds. I have long missed
      the ability to search for articles I remember having read a few
      weeks or months ago;
      though I typically find it with an appropriately phrased Google
      Search, 
      I've always wanted to have the ability to restrict the search to
      the feeds I subscribe to --- this makes formulating   the query
      much easier.</p>
      <p>The advent of CSEs --- see my earlier blog post 
      entitled <a
      
      
      href='http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2007/06/making-search-fly-on-fly-custom-search.html'>On
      The Fly Custom Search</a>
      combined with Google Reader's ability to export ones
      subscription      list as an OPML file gives me exactly what  I
      needed.</p>
      
      <h2>HowTo: Enable Searching Of  Past Articles From Google
      Reader</h2>
      
      <ul>
      <li>Since you need to be signed in to access the subscription
      list, the <em>CSE magic</em> cannot directly retrieve 
      your subscription list at present.
      as a consequence, you need to retrieve and save your list of
      feeds   to a location that is publicly accessible.
      Feature Request: Would be nice if Reader did this automatically
      by talking to CSE on behalf of the signed-in user --- that would
      obviate the next manual step.</li>
      <li>Export your subscription list using command
      <code>greader-opml</code>.
      You'll need to do  an <code>svn update</code>
      to get the above command; alternatively, sign in to Google and
      retrieve your 
      <a
      
      
      href='http://www.google.com/reader/subscriptions/export'>subscription list</a>.</li>
      <li>Finally,   customize emacspeak option 
      <code>emacspeak-url-template-reading-list-opml</code> to
      the
      location of the saved OPML file.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Now, you can use Emacspeak <code>url
      template</code>
      <em>reader subscription search</em> from the Emacspeak
      Web
      Command Line to search articles you remember having seen in your
      Google Reader. This is also an excellent means of finding
      articles of interest that one might have missed in the past.
      As an example, I recently became interested in Selenium --- an
      extremely powerful Web application testing framework.
      Finding articles from the past that I <em>ought to have
      read</em>
      but hadn't was a snap using the feature describe here.</p>

      Search</a> last year.</p>
      <p>So in the spirit of continuing to enhance the Web Command
      Line
      in Emacspeak for every smart Web tool that becomes available,
      I've checked in two new <code>url templates</code>
      that demonstrate how one can  leverage this to be smart  and
      selective about what one reads.</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Searching Favorite Feeds</dt>
      <dd>So I read a lot of Blogs, my current Blog Reader is Google
      Reader via --- you guessed it -- Emacs module 
      <a
      
      
      href='http://emacspeak.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/lisp/g-client/greader.el'>GReader</a>
      (part of the Emacs G-Client package).
      But I often  feel the need to search my favorite feeds.
      URL-template <code>Reader Subscriptions</code>
      lets you do this; what's more it's not specific to Google
      Reader. All you need do is to publish an OPML file listing  your
      favorite feeds  and customize Emacs variable
      <code>emacspeak-url-template-reading-list-opml</code>
      to point to that location.</dd>
      <dt>Official GoogleBlog Search</dt>
      <dd>Google has a large number of Google-specific Blogs --- I
      usually read them through this <em>aggregated</em> feed:
      <a
      
      
      href='http://www.google.com/reader/public/subscriptions/user/10949413115399023739/label/officialgoogleblogs-all'>All
      GoogleBlog Stream</a>
      Emacspeak wizard <code>Official GoogleBlog Search</code>
      builds a
      CSE from this feed to let you search articles from all of
      Google's  blogs.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Eventually, I'll also add a <em>meta</em>
      search
      wizard that
      lets  one construct any CSE on the fly --- with Lisp such
      meta-programming is a snap!</p>
      <p>Later yesterday evening, I checked in a third
      <code>url-template</code>
      called <em>On The Fly CSE</em> that prompts for a search
      term
      and
      the URL for the  feed of feeds  that specifies the content to
      search.</p>

      <p>
      I've finally found the right development environment for myself
      for writing and debugging Web Applications that use JavaScript to
      implement client-side interaction.
      It turns out that it wasn't't just me who found the thought of
      programming inside the Web browser a painful experience ---
      pleasant though the final end-user interaction that those results
      deliver might be for the final user.
      I discovered 
      <a
      
      
      href='http://dev.hyperstruct.net/mozlab/wiki/MozRepl'>MozRepl</a>
      --- a <em>read-eval-print</em>
      loop for Firefox. MozRepl is a Firefox extension that allows you
      to open a connection to a running Firefox session and gain access
      to  a JavaScript interpreter context that  can access all aspects
      of the Firefox runtime.</p>
      <p>This is quite neat, I can now use the power of Emacs to
      write
      and debug end-user JavaScript applications.
      But wait, there is more. So in general, as someone who doesn't
      need  to suffer from the hit on cycles and memory that running an X
      environment involves, 
      I usually dont start <code>GDM</code> --- the graphical
      desktop
      --- on my Linux box. Believe me, running just at the console,
      especially with the LCD turned off makes my laptop run a lot
      longer.
      So challenge: How do you take the fox's head off Firefox?
      How do you run a headless Firefox?</p>
      <p>Turns out that the original X Windows developers didn't
      always
      have access to all the displays that they were developing X
      applications for --- so they created <code>XVFB</code>
      ---
      the X
      Virtual Frame Buffer server.
      Like all good things in the Open Source world, XVFB continues to
      survive --- even though today, X developers hardly if ever resort
      to XVFB.
      But in the fine UNIX tradition of 
      <quote>Get out of my way or I'll turn you into a shell
      script</quote>
      XVFB also turns out to be just what I needed in order to run
      FireFox as a headless application.</p>
      <p>So in summary: I'm typing this blog on the shuttle bus
      ridinghome, with the monitor turned off,
      and Firefox running headless as I debug some of the code I've
      been writing.
      If you want to put the fox's head in a box yourself, here is a
      pointer to

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>
      This essay outlines some of my experiences as a mathematician
      who cannot see. Note that I transitioned to being a Computer
      Scientist during Graduate School. However I strongly believe in
      the edict <q>Once a mathematician, always a
      mathematician!</q>  — my training in mathematics continues
      to      influence the
      way I think.
      </p>
      <p>
      I've been unable to see since the age of 14, which means that
      I've studied and practiced mathematics predominantly in an
      eyes-free environment. This essay is my first conscious attempt
      at asking the question <q>What is involved in doing
      mathematics      when you cannot see?</q> I hope that some of
      the
      experiences outlined here will prove insightful to
      mathematicians at large. At its heart, mathematics is about
      understanding the underlying structure inherent in a given area
      of interest — and where no such structure exists — to
      define the minimal structure that is needed to make forward
      progress.
      </p>
      <p>
      The general perception that mathematics might be hard to do in
      an eyes-free environment probably traces itself to the common
      view of mathematics as a field where one performs copious
      calculations on paper. I'll illustrate some of the habits and
      abilities one evolves over time to compensate for the lack of
      ready access to <em>scratch memory</em> provided by
      pencil
      and  paper when working in an eyes-free environment. In this essay,
      I hope to demonstrate that mathematics in its essence is
      something far bigger. By being bigger than <q>calculations on
      paper</q>, not being able to see rarely if ever proves an
      obstacle when it comes to doing mathematics; the challenges one
      needs to overcome are primarily centered around gaining access
      to mathematical material, and communicating ones insights with
      fellow mathematicians. Thus, a large portion of this essay
      focuses on solutions to the challenges inherent in mathematical
      communication.

      <p>Blogging while at WWW 2007.
      I attended the W3C AC meeting the first two days of the week. The
      highlight for me from the AC (Advisory Committee meeting was a
      panel consisting  of TimBL and Tim OReilly at the end of the day
      yesterday. It was fun to hear Tim OReilly  define Web-2.0 --- he
      is credited with originally coining the term, but in the last
      year, Web 2.0 has often been lightly equated to  
      dynamic Web applications that use JavaScript to the extent that
      many assume that anything that doesn't  use JavaScript is not
      Web-2.0!</p>
      <p>The gist of Tim O's definition of Web-2.0 was 
      to point out that once  the Web had gained sufficient coverage
      and scale, it became possible to build application services on
      this Web that drew their value from aggregating the data on the
      Web; his examples ranged from Google to Amazon.
      His comments were insightful --- my own view now is that Web-2.0
      should have been called Web^2 i.e. this current revolution is
      about applying the power of the Web to itself.
      </p>
      <p>The other amusing piece while running around at the
      conference
      and observing what everyone is working on is to realize that now
      that <em>Web Gadgets</em> and the like are popular,
      it's
      now
      considered a fine idea to write light-weight site-specific
      tools. Notice that Emacspeak has had this since the late 90's in
      the form of first the <em>websearch</em> module, to be
      later
      joined by <em>url-templates</em>. I believe thesee
      innovations
      arrived earlier on the Emacspeak Webtop as compared to the rest
      of the Web for the following reasons:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Emacspeak relied on Emacs/W3 for Web functionality,and
      when      that browser stopped being maintained, there was a strong
      need to
      develop Web tools in the context of Emacspeak.</li>
      <li>The visual Web was getting too complex  for use via speech
      output,
      and given the flexibility of the Emacs environment, and the
      arrival of XSLT in 1999, things were well set up to build a
      powerful set of Web access wizards.</li>
      <li>Task-oriented Web tools in Emacspeak led to the conceptual
      <strong>Web Command Line</strong> in Emacspeak at a time
      when
      <em>command-line interfaces</em> were considered
      passe'.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Incidentally when I showed others working in the field of
      accessibility thesee Emacspeak tools during their early days, they
      were promptly dismissed as site-specific hacks that wouldn't
      scale in the face of generic screenreaders that would
      <em>handle
      every web page</em>.
      With the visual Web getting too busy for
      <em>everyone</em>
      mainstream users now have access to productivity solutions such
      as Apple's Dashboard Widgets, IGoogle modules that can be placed
      on a Web page or the desktop, and other comparable tools. It will
      be interesting to see how much longer blind users saddled with
      commercial screenreaders will have to wait before seeing similar
      tools emerge in their world --- just remember, when that does
      arrive, Emacspeak had them in 2000!</p>

      <h2>1 An Emacs Interface To Google Services</h2>
      
      
      <p>
      Google offers a number of services using a Google account. Many
      of thesee services also expose a Web API. this package provides a
      set of Emacs modules for accessing thesee services from inside
      Emacs. These modules are designed with an Emacs-centric, rather
      than a Web-browser centered view of the world. Where necessary
      Emacs package <code>browse-url</code> is used to invoke
      the
      Web browser of
      choice. 
      </p>
      <p>
      The current distribution can be downloaded from <a
      
      
      href='http://emacspeak.googlecode.com/files/g-client.tar.bz2'>Google Code Hosting</a> and the source code is available via <a href='http://emacspeak.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/lisp/g-client/'>Subversion</a>. Note
      that this is still work in progress. I'm releasing it as part of
      the Emacspeak project since I believe the package already has
      sufficiently useful functionality for users who spend a large
      amount of their time inside Emacs. There is no dependency on
      Emacspeak, and all clients provided here can be used without
      Emacspeak loaded.
      </p>
      
      <h3>1.1 Installation</h3>
      
      
      <p>
      These are needed only if installing package
      <code>g-client</code>
      stand-alone, i.e. outside of Emacspeak.
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      Unpack the tar archive and place the resulting
      <code>g-client</code>
      directory on your emacs <code>load-path</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
      Type <code>make</code> to compile the code.
      </li>
      <li>
      In your .emacs, add <code>(load-library
      "g")</code>
      to set it up.
      
      </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>1.2 How It Works</h3>
      
      
      <p>
      Clients are implemented using Google APIs based on Atom
      Publishing Protocol <a
      
      
      href='http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-09.html'>APP</a> and Google Data APIs (<a href='http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/index.html'>GData</a>). We use <code>curl</code>
      to retrieve content via <i>HTTPS</i> and
      <code>xsltproc</code> to transform the
      retrieved content to browsable HTML.
      </p>
      <p>
      Clients sign you in the first time you invoke commands that require
      authentication. Once signed in, the session cookie is cached for
      future
      use. Session cookies presently expire in 30 minutes, and clients
      check
      forexpired cookies when authentication is needed. If the cookie has
      expired,
      clients retrieve a fresh cookie using the authentication credentials
      provided
      earlier. Note that authorization tokens etc are specific to a
      given service.
      </p>
      
      <h3>1.3 Top-level Customizations</h3>
      
      
      <p>
      All clients in this package use Emacs'
      <code>customize</code> interface to
      set user preferences.
      The most commonly used  ones are enumerated below.
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <code>g-user-email</code> Default email-id to use.
      Individual
      clients
      typically override this via user option
      <code>&lt;clientname&gt;-user-email</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
      <code>g-html-handler</code> Name of function that
      handles      HTML content.
      
      </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>1.4 Google Blogger <i>gblogger</i></h3>
      
      
      <p>
      This client implements posting, editing and deleting of blog
      entries using the new Blogger API --- it replaces the now
      obsolete <a
      
      
      href='http://emacsgeek.blogspot.com/2006/01/announcing-atom-blogger.html'>atom-blogger</a> that implemented similar functionality
      using the old Blogger API. It uses value of customization option
      <code>g-user-email</code> by default; this can be
      overridden
      via option
      <code>gblogger-user-email</code>. See <a
      
      
      href='http://code.google.com/apis/blogger/overview.html'>Blogger GData API</a> for the underlying
      APIs used. For editing posts, I recommend installing <a
      
      
      href='http://www.thaiopensource.com/nxml-mode/'>nxml-mode</a>.
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <i>Browse</i> Command
      <code>gblogger-blog</code>
      brings up the list of blogs
      owned by the currently authenticated user.
      </li>
      <li>
      <i>Posting</i> Command
      <code>gblogger-new-entry</code> takes a <b>post
      URL</b> and sets
      up a special buffer where you can compose your
      article. the <b>post url</b> is obtained from the feed
      of      blogs
      above, use the <b>post</b> link for the blog to which
      you      wish to
      post.
      </li>
      <li>
      <i>Browsing</i>      Command
      <code>gblogger-atom-display</code> displays the
      atom feed for a specified blog as a browsable HTML page. In
      addition to reading your blog, this helps you find the <b>edit
         
      url</b> for individual posts.
      </li>
      <li>
      <i>Editing</i> Command
      <code>gblogger-edit-entry</code> takes the <b>edit
      url</b>
      of a previously posted entry. It retrieves the entry, and
      sets up a special composition buffer where you can edit the entry.
      </li>
      <li>
      <i>Submitting</i> The special composition buffer created
      by
      commands <code>gblogger-new-entry</code> and
      <code>gblogger-edit-entry</code>
      provide a special command <code>gblogger-publish</code>
      (bound to <code>C-c     C-c</code>) that submits the
      entry to
      blogger.
      </li>
      <li>
      <i>Deleting</i> Command
      <code>gblogger-delete-entry</code> deletes an entry
      specified by its <b>edit url</b>.
      
      </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>1.5 Google Calendar <i>gcal</i></h3>
      
      
      <p>
      This client can be used to view, add or delete events from the
      Google Calendar for the authenticated user. It uses value of
      customization option <code>g-user-email</code> by
      default;
      this can be
      overridden via option <code>gcal-user-email</code>.
      Commands
      that display
      calendar items optionally accept the feed url of the calendar to
      view; this can be used to view calendars to which the
      authenticated user has read access. See <a
      
      
      href='http://code.google.com/apis/calendar/overview.html'>GData Calendar API</a> for
      the underlying APIs used.
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <i>View</i> Command
      <code>gcal-calendar-agenda</code> displays the default
      calendar for the authenticated user. A prefix arg prompts for
      the calendar to display. This command is best used from
      inside the Emacs calendar; in this case, it uses the date
      under point when showing the agenda.
      </li>
      <li>
      <i>Add</i> Command
      <code>gcal-add-event</code>
      prompts for event details and
      adds it to the calendar.
      </li>
      <li>
      <i>Accept</i> Command
      <code>gcal-accept-event</code> accepts an event. Event
      is specified using the <b>edit url</b> of the event.
      </li>
      <li>
      <i>Delete</i> Command
      <code>gcal-delete-event</code> deletes an event. Event
      is specified using the <b>edit url</b> of the event.
      
      </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>1.6 Google Reader <i>greader</i></h3>
      
      
      <p>
      This client allows the authenticated user to read, browse and
      subscribe/unsubscribe to feeds.
      It uses value of customization option
      <code>g-user-email</code> by
      default; this can be overridden via option
      <code>g-user-email</code>.
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <i>Reading</i> Command
      <code>greader-reading-list</code> displays the
      reading list (river of news).
      </li>
      <li>
      <i>Browsing</i> Command
      <code>greader-feed-list</code> displays a
      browsable Web page with pointers to  subscribed feeds.
      </li>
      <li>
      <i>Finding</i> Command
      <code>greader-find-feeds</code> searches for matching
      feeds to subscribe.
      </li>
      <li>
      <i>Subscribing</i> Commands
      <code>greader-subscribe-feed</code> and
      <code>greader-unsubscribe-feed</code> are used to
      subscribe
      and
      unsubscribe.
      </li>
      <li>
      <i>Labeling</i> Command
      <code>greader-star</code>
      and <code>greader-add-label</code> are
      used to label articles.
      </li>
      <li>
      <i>Reading</i> Starred  articles can be read by
      providing a prefix argument to command
      <code>greader-reading-list</code>. Thus, C-u M-x
      greader-reading-list
      will prompt for the specific set of articles to retrieve.
      
      </li>

    <h2><a name="idm2119" id="idm2119">
      Emacspeak Downloads On GoogleCode
    </a></h2>
<div>
<br>
      <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
      <p>
      I've now made all Emacspeak releases available from the download
      area on Googlecode.
      Going forward, all Emacspeak releases will be made at the
      GoogleCode site   --- not SourceForge. This is because uploading
      code to GoogleCode is <em>significantly</em> easier than
      making
      releases on SourceForge.</p>
      
      <p>But even more importantly, once uploaded, grabbing a
      release      from GoogleCode is significantly easier than on
      SourceForge's
      release mechanisms.
      You can always find a link to the latest releases from Emacspeak
      on GoogleCode 
      by starting from the 
      <a
      href='http://code.google.com/p/emacspeak/'>Emacspeak     
      GoogleCode</a> page.
      Follow the link labeled <em>Featured Downloads</em> to
      download
      the newest release. I've also made all past releases from the
      download area --- follow the link labeled
      <em>downloads</em>
      on
      the Emacspeak GoogleCode page.</p>
      
      <p>Here is a brief summary of why I  chose to start making
      releases on GoogleCode, it can be viewed as a short summary of
      the positives in making the switch.</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li> GoogleCode makes it possible to create download URLs 
      that      can be bookmarked.
      No more clicking through multiple pages before getting to the
      file you want, you can simply point <code>wget</code>,
      <code>curl</code> or your favorite download tool at a
      meaningful
      URL.
      For instance,  
      here is a pointer to 
      
      <a
      
      
      href='http://emacspeak.googlecode.com/files/emacspeak-25.tar.bz2'>Emacspeak
      25</a> release.</li>
      <li>The above is more than a convenience --- it's in line
      with
      good Web architecture. I've  been looking for an alternative to
      SourceForge ever since that site decided to turn meaningful
      download URLs from the past into obfuscated pointers into their
      content management system; this left me with a feeling of having
      created Open Source Software only to have it locked away in
      someone else's vault with no easy mechanism for end-users to
      retrieve what had been released as free software.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Share And Enjoy --- and let's hope we never have
      download
      sites that say <em>Glad to be of service </em>
      as they close behind you with a sigh of a job well done.</p>

    <h2><a name="idm2133" id="idm2133">IBM
      Software TTS On Ubuntu 6 
    </a></h2>
<div>
<br><div
      xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>
      I had earlier reported the IBM TTS engine segfaulting on my home
      Ubuntu 6 machine; I'm still to fix that problem. 
      Surprisingly though, I tried it on a different Ubuntu 6 machine,
      and there, installing 
      <pre>
      sudo apt-get install libstdc++2.10-glibc2.2
      </pre>
      on top of the regular Ubuntu install was enough to get the TTS
      working.
      The segfault on my home machine occurs inside libc, and as best I
      can tell the two machines have identical libc installs. 
      So on the positive front, it's only my home machine that appears
      broken; on the negative side, the fact that the breakage is hard
      to explain and hence fix doesn't inspire confidence  in
      upgrading.
      Others have reported not having any problems on Edgy -- so the
      problem is hopefully transitory.

      Emacspeak 25.0 (ActiveDog) Unleashed 
    </a></h2>
<div>
<br><div
      xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>I released Emacspeak 25.0 (ActiveDog) yesterday.
      Here are the <a
      
      
      href="http://emacspeak.sf.net/releases/release-25.0.html">release
      notes</a>.</p>
      <p>While trying to release it on Sourceforge I ran into a
      couple
      of show-stoppers --- first off the SourceForge download mechanism
      has changed <em>yet again</em> and it's now gotten
      sufficiently
      convoluted that  software released via SourceForge's file
      release      system is becoming well-nigh impossible to download
      except for
      the most motivated user. Worse, as I released the file, upload
      services on SourceForge hung, with a consequence that it created
      a 0 sized <code>emacspeak-25.tar.bz2</code> file --- the
      SourceForge mechanism  made it well-nigh impossible to clean up
      the 0-sized file.</p>
      <p>Given this mess, I decided to keep things simple by placing
      the <a
      
      href="http://emacspeak.sf.net/emacspeak-25.tar.bz2">release
      on
      the Emacspeak site </a> directly -- this suffers from the
      disadvantage of the release not getting mirrored on the various
      Sourceforge download archives; it has the advantage of allowing
      users to grab the release with one click.</p>
      
      <p>The other thing to note about this release is that there
      are      no RPMs built  --- a first in 7 years. I've now
      switched to
      Ubuntu on my home machine and dont have the ability to build RPMs
      so I'll leave this  to individual distributions. I've also
      not
      built Debian packages this time around, mostly because I've not
      gotten around to understanding Debian's packaging system
      sufficiently well to do this. Moreover I prefer minimalistic
      packaging solutions --- and in general  though Debian's
      packaging      is nice, it still feels a little too heavy-weight for
      something
      like the Emacspeak source tarball which needs a simple
      <code>make; sudo make install</code> to get set up.
      So for now, I'll rely on folks like Jim Van Zandt to build
      downstream Debian 
      packages  for incorporating with the various distributions like
      Debian and Ubuntu --- this way, packages can be built to match
      particular distributions.</p>

      Helix Player From Emacspeak 
    </a></h2>
<div>
<br><div
      xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>In the spirit of <q>You can never have  sufficiently
      many
      media players</q>, I now have Helix Player working under
      Emacspeak  <em>i.e.,</em> 
      I can now run Helix Player without having to start up X. This is
      useful because there are still media streams on the Web that
      sometimes fail with <code>mplayer</code>, and from the
      minimaltesting I've done so far, Helix Player is successful in
      those
      cases.</p>
      
      <h3>What Is It?</h3>
      <p>HelixPlayer --- installable on  modern Linux 
      distributions as <code>hxplay</code> from package
      <code>HelixPlayer</code> is the community-supported
      version
      ofRealPlayer 10. The well-distributed and documented client,
      <code>hxplay</code>
      is capable of playing a wide variety of audio and video formats
      over HTTP and RTSP/RTP, and specifically, can handle RealPlayer10
      formats which includes support for <em>5.1</em>
      audio.</p>
      
      <p>A lesser known set of tools available from Helix ---<a
      
      
      href="http://forms.helixcommunity.org/helix/builds/?category=helixdnaclient">
      Helix DNA Client</a> is a bare-bones UI-less player which can
      be
      used effectively  at the shell. You can download pre-built
      binaries for your flavor of Linux (GCC3.2 or later vs GCC 2.95
      based systems) 
      note that thesee are 
      nightly builds. You can also download a source zip archive. Note
      that all of thesee requires you to accept a 
      End Users License Agreement (<code>EULA</code>)
      before being taken to the download link.</p>
      <p>The links on the page above can be confusing; Here are
      pointers to the specific packages you need to grab  if you want a
      player that has all of the functionality described above.</p>

      <h3>Using The Binary Distribution</h3>
      
      <p>Here is what I did you set up the binary distribution on my
      Ubuntu 6.0.6 (Dapper) machine</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li>Unpacked  <a
      
      
      href="http://forms.helixcommunity.org/helix/builds/index.html?filename=20060926/all_clients-helix-20060926-linux-2.2-libc6-gcc32-i586.tar.gz">binary
      package</a>
      under <code>/usr/lib</code>.</li>
      <li>Created a symlink  <code>/usr/lib/splay</code>
      to
      point to
      the directory created  by unpacking the binary package.</li>
      <li>Created the following shell script
      <code>/usr/bin/hsplay</code>
      to launch the player:
      <pre>
      #!/bin/sh
      #Use Simple Helix Player:
      #
      SPLAY_LIB=/usr/lib/splay
      export HELIX_LIBS=$SPLAY_LIB
      exec /usr/bin/aoss $SPLAY_LIB/splay -iss -s "$@"
      </pre>
      </li>
      <li> The above script assumes you have the
      <code>alsa-oss</code>
      package installed; you will need this to have Helix Player use
      ALSA --- something that is essential if you want to be able to
      use your sound card with other applications while playing media
      streams.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With this setup, you can launch one or more media streams
      (both local, as well as remote HTTP/RTSP/RTP streams)
      from a shell.
      This player successfully plays the <code>BBC Radio4
      LW</code>
      stream, something <code>mplayer</code>
      fails to play on my Ubuntu box.</p>

      Emacspeak 24 On Ubuntu 6

<div>
<br><div
      xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>I upgraded my home FC3 machine to Ubuntu 6.0.6 (Dapper)
      over      the weekend. Here is a short summary for things to watch
      out for
      as an emacspeak user.</p>
      <h2>The Good, The Bad, And The Painful</h2>
      
      <dl>
      <dt>Good</dt>
      <dd>One of my friends helped with the install and it is
      remarkably quick when everything works (in my case the Ubuntu LTS
      6.0.6 installer had trouble with the NVidea display card and
      came up correctly at the third attempt).</dd>
      <dt>Bad</dt>
      <dd>A one CD install is nice -- but after it you have
      remarkably
      little installed from the perspective of an emacspeak user. You
      end up with a very nice GUI but very little else --- the
      reasoning being that the average user won't need much more, and
      the savvy user can always run
      <code>apt-get</code>.</dd><dt>Bad</dt>
      <dd>Worse, Ubuntu does not install
      <code>openssh-server</code>
      --- it limits itself to installing
      <code>openssh-client</code>. This means that you cannot
      bootstrap
      yourself by logging in from another machine until you install
      <code>openssh-server</code> off the network. If there
      was one
      thing I would ask the Ubuntu maintainers, it would be to rectify
      this situation.</dd>
      <dt>Painful</dt>
      <dd>In my case, the <code>apt</code> suite of
      tools      appeared to
      have a problem --- they died saying
      <code>/var/lib/dpkg/available: no such file or
      directory</code>. Googling showed this to be a known problem
      with
      <code>apt</code> and the fix is to run
      <code>dselect
      update</code> -- but if you're new to Debian/ubuntu,  this
      is
      less than obvious.</dd>
      <dt>Good</dt>
      <dd>Once you overcome the above,
      <code>apt-get</code>
      got me
      emacspeak-17.0 which was sufficient to let me bootstrap the rest
      of the process on my own using my trusted Dectalk Express to
      produce speech.</dd>
      <dt>Painful</dt>
      <dd>Note that you should install
      <code>tcl8.3</code>
      and<code>tclx8.3</code> --- rather than the newest (8.4)
      versions of
      thesee packages.
      This is because as of 8.4, the maintainers of those packages no
      longer build a stand-alone <code>tcl</code> (extended
      TCL)
      shell. This is something that will have to be handled by
      Emacspeak in the future.</dd>
      <dt>Good</dt>
      <dd>I was able to get everything I needed (and more) installed
      using a combination of <code>apt-get</code> and
      <code>aptitude</code>.</dd>
      <dt>Bad</dt>
      <dd>The IBM TTS engine no longer works --- under FC3 and
      friends,
      you needed to install package
      <code>libstdc++-compat</code>
      toget it to work. Well, there is no corresponding package for
      Ubuntu/Debian from what I could find out, and pulling in the RPM
      for <code>libstdc++-compat</code>,
      converting it via <code>alien</code> and installing the
      resultproduces a segfault when you run the TTS engine.</dd>
      <dt>Bad</dt>
      <dd>For the same reason, the old command-line
      <code>trplayer</code> will also not work on Ubuntu 6.0.
      This is not as painful --- since mplayer works --- though I had
      to build <code>mplayer</code> from source.
      It would be nice to create a command-line player on top of the
      HelixPlayer code base.
      At present, the missing <code>trplayer</code> means that
      the
      <code>etc/rivo.pl</code> provided by emacspeak no longer
      works.
      You can use <code>mplayer</code> to  convert
      <code>realaudio</code> to mp3; however
      <code>mplayer</code>does
      not have a command-line option to specify the duration of
      playback,
      something that  script <code>etc/rivo.pl</code>
      needs.</dd>

      I've checked in the Emacspeak codebase into the Subversion
      repository provided by <a

      </a>.
      The project page is <a
      href="http://code.google.com/p/emacspeak">Emacspeak at

      You can find Emacspeak --- complete  with its code history going

      <a
      href="http://emacspeak.googlecode.com/svn/">Emacspeak
      SVN
      Repository</a>.</p>
      
      <p>For now, the Emacspeak Web site will continue to live at
      Sourceforge; The Emacspeak mailing list will continue to live at
      Vassar as before.
      To checkout the code from SVN, follow the instructions on 
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/emacspeak/source">
      Emacspeak SVN</a>.
      If you run into any hitches  in checking out the code, please
      report it on the Emacspeak mailing list. Note that you can
      anonymous checkout the code from the above location entirely from
      the shell command-line without ever having to point a browser at
      anything.</p>
      <p>Emacspeak users presently running out of SourceForge CVS
      might
      want to do an SVN checkout in a separate directory and make sure
      things work, in preparation for a permanent switch-over to
      svn. Here are the minimal steps you need to perform: 
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li><code>svn checkout
      http://emacspeak.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
      emacspeak </code></li>
      <li>The above will create a directory called
      <code>emacspeak</code> with the code under it;
      obviously, you
      should do this somewhere different from where you have  your
      current copy of emacspeak.</li>
      <li>For now, I recommend renaming the directory created in the
      above step to <code>svn-emacspeak</code> so that you can
      easily
      tell  which snapshot you're looking at. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note that
      reading thesee is not a replacement for learning about SVN ---
      there is an excellent on-line book available at

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>I've received a number of queries asking about the
      differences
      between Emacspeak and Speechdel ---especially given some of the
      somewhat confusing assertions made in recent Speechdel release
      announcements. I'm posting this article in the hope of clearing
      up some of this confusion.
      </p>
      <h2>
      <a name="sec-1">1 Emacspeak And Speechdel  -*-
      mode:org
      -*-</a>
      </h2>
      <h3>
      <a name="sec-2">1.1 Background</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
      <a
      href="http://emacspeak.sf.net">Emacspeak</a>     
      speech-enables Emacs by advising core emacs
      functionality.  Speech services are provided by a simple
      Emacspeak speech-server.  Additionally, Emacspeak implements
      speech-extensions for popular emacs modules --- see the 
      <a
      
      
      href="http://emacspeak.sf.net/applications.html">speech-enabled applications list</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      Emacspeak was first released in 1995, and then (as now), there
      was limited speech access to the Linux GUI.  Therefore, to be
      useful as a complete access solution, Emacspeak has always needed
      to enable the user to <b>do everything</b> from within
      Emacs,
      not just
      regular editing operations. As a case in point, emacspeak users
      are probably one of the last remaining communities that use Emacs
      for browsing the Web.
      </p>
      <h3>
      <a name="sec-3">1.2 Speech Dispatcher
      (SpeechD)</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
      The idea of SpeechD --- peech Dispatcher as an intermediate layer
      between speech clients and TTS engines was first floated sometime
      in the late 90's.  Such a common layer is a laudible goal but is
      something that takes time and effort to get right. Additionally,
      you have the challenge of getting existing software e.g.,
      emacspeak, to abandon their own speech abstraction and
      re-implement against a supposedly more generic, but completely
      untested and untried intermediate layer.
      </p>
      <p>
      The developers of SpeechD initially incorporated some of the
      Emacspeak code into an Emacs wrapper (speechdel) that called
      SpeechD, but later decided to go their own way -- and present
      <a
      
      
      href="http://www.freebsoft.org/speechd-el">speechdel</a> is the result.
      </p>
      <p>
      Like Emacspeak, speechdel uses Emacs Lisp's advice facility to
      add spoken feedback to core editing commands; speech output is
      produced by calling out to speech-dispatcher.
      </p>
      <p>
      The summary of feature differences between Emacspeak and speechdel
      in the
      next section is from examining the speechdel code-base; I have
      not run speechdel since its dependency chain resulting from
      speechd was difficult to resolve on my FC3 64bit machine.
      </p>
      <h3>
      <a name="sec-4">1.3 Emacspeak Features Not Found In
      SpeechDel</a>
      </h3>
      <ol>
      <li>
      Emacspeak implements Aural CSS <a
      
      href="http://www.w3.org/Press/1998/CSS2-REC">ACSS</a>,
      and uses it to  provides
      the aural analog of <code>font-lock</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
      Emacspeak provides pronunciation
      dictionaries. Pronunciations can be defined on a per-mode,
      per-buffer or per-directory basis. Directory and mode
      specific pronunciations are persisted across sessions. This
      allows Emacspeak to leverage Emacs' intelligence about the
      semantics of a given application; thus, you can have
      it say "p arrow x" for "p-&gt;x" when
      editing C
      code. Per-directory pronunciations are useful for reading
      electronic books. Per-buffer pronunciations are useful for
      succinctly speaking long lines of shell output e.g. when
      compiling complex software.
      </li>
      <li>
      By advising core Emacs functionality, Emacs modes work out
      of the box with Emacspeak. But in most cases, Emacspeak goes
      one step further by providing light-weight speech-modules
      that specialize spoken output for a given mode. As an
      example, advising next-line to speak the current line is
      sufficient to use <code>dired-mode</code> --- but having
      to
      listen to
      the entire line of dired output is not a pleasant
      experience. The dired-specific module in Emacspeak advises
      all interactive dired commands to speak the "right"
      information. As an another example, GOOD interaction
      automatically speaks the line of source-code without leaving
      the <b>Good</b> buffer.
      </li>
      <li>
      Emacspeak comes with many "Emacs Applets" for performing
      tasks that most users would perform outside of
      Emacs. Examples include playing CDs, playing multimedia
      streams etc. Fortunately, I have not had to write too many
      of thesee since there are always Emacs users other than
      myself who also create such Emacs applications --- so where
      Emacs applications already exist, I merely speech-enable
      them with a small set of advice definitions, and in some
      cases add a few additional interactive commands.
      </li>
      <li>
      Emacs applications are plentiful for most tasks; one
      exception is the Web. Since emacs/w3 development was
      abandoned sometime around 1998, I have added significant Web
      interaction functionality to Emacspeak using Emacs/W3 as the
      basis. Today, a lot of this has also been ported to
      Emacs/W3M thanks to other enthusiasts on the Emacspeak
      mailing list.  Examples include:
      <ol>
      <li>
      WebSearch module --- prompts for query and processes
      response to focus on the results.
      </li>
      <li>
      XSLT pre-processing: Allows pre-processing of complex
      pages before rendering via W3. Used to enable
      <b>smart</b>
      screen-scrapers using XPath.
      </li>
      <li>
      URL-Tempaltes: Originally motivated by
      <code>webjump.el</code>, this
      provides url templates that enable easy access to a
      variety of Web tasks rangig from looking up flight times
      to listening to your favorite NPR or BBc show. Think early
      cut at a "Web Command Line in the minibuffer".
      </li>
      </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
      Customization via Custom, including additional
      keymaps. Comes with additional keymap files for the Linux
      console to enable <code>hyper</code>,
      <code>super</code>, and <code>alt</code>
      prefix
      keymaps.
      </li>
      <li>
      Module emacspeak-wizards iplements a large collection of
      Emacs wizards that enable common tasks that you would
      otherwise perform at the shell e.g., checking display status
      on a laptop. The additional prefix keymaps come in handy!
      </li>
      </ol>
      8)Finally, note that <b>all</b> modules (except the
      core) are
      loaded
      on demand.All code is compiled with
      <code>byte-compile-dynamic</code> set to
      =T=  and individual application-specific modules  are kept
      completely independent of one another. Given the size of the
      Emacspeak codebase, this is a  pre-requisite for both efficiency
      and developer sanity.

      legacy loop
      for those few applications that still have the old
      <code>OSS</code> API hard-wired.</p>
      <p>One such useful application is
      <code>trplayer</code>
      --- the
      command-line <em>real player</em> that has not been
      updated
      inover 4 years.
      For the most part, the functionality provided by
      <code>trplayer</code> is subsumed by the newer --- and
      actively
      maintained --- <code>mplayer</code> but it's still
      useful
      to have
      <code>trplayer</code> for times when
      <code>mplayer</code> hits
      gliches with slow-responding RTSP streams.</p>
      <p>The ALSA way of handling such legacy applications is
      through      the <em>ALSA OSS</em> emulation layer;
      Emacspeak now contains
      a
      script <code>etc/atrplayer</code> that invokes
      <code>trplayer</code> via <code>aoss</code>.
            Incidentally for
      the more observant Emacspeak user running out of CVS, script
      <code>atrplayer</code> is not new; it has been around
      for      about a
      year, but until now it used command <code>vsound</code>
      to
      stream
      the converted audio to command <code>aplay</code>. I
      needed
      to do
      this until ALSA 1.0.11 since <code>trplayer</code> used
      to
      fail
      sporadically if run through the <code>AOSS</code>
      emulation
      layer.  But those problems now seem to be in the past with the
      upgrade to ALSA 1.0.11.  As usual with cutting edge technology
      like ALSA, your mileage with <strong>all of
      this</strong>      will vary; so
      let me end with the usual disclaimer --- if it breaks, you get to
      keep both pieces.</p>

      and ASYM</a>
      I mentioned that <code>speakfreely</code> appeared to
      have
      stopped working.
      As it turns out, this had nothing to do with the switch to
      ASYM. I believe that in the past I had run speakfreely by first
      killing software TTS --- since by default
      <code>speakfreely</code> uses OSS.</p>
      <p>Getting <code>speakfreely</code> working with
      ALSA
      without
      losing software TTS required the following steps;</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Retrieve the latest  tarball 
      <code>speak_freely-7.6a.tar.gz</code></li>
      <li>Uncomment the <code>ALSA</code> specific line
      in
      its<code>Makefile</code></li>
      <li>In file <code>audio_alsa.c</code>, change the
      default audio
      device from <code>plughw:0,0</code> to
      <code>default</code>.
      Without this change, speakfreely will try to  access the sound
      card directly; setting it to <code>default</code>
      on line 41:
      <pre>
      char *devAudioOutput = "default";
      </pre>
      matches things up with the <code>pcm.default</code> that
      was
      configured in the <code>.asoundrc</code>.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>With this, you can now talk using
      <code>speakfreely</code> and
      continue to use software TTS.

      This is a continuation of the earlier thread about using ALSA for
      software TTS using DMix ---
      see <a
      
      
      href="http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2006/05/asoundrc-parameters-for-reliably-using.html">ASoundrc
      And Emacspeak</a>.</p>
      
      <p>I've now updated the CVS version of
      <code>ASoundRC</code> to
      use the <code>ASYM</code>
      plugin for the default ALSA device. 
      The <code>ASYM</code> plugin allows you to configure
      both the
      playback and capture device, which removes the annoyance of
      having to specify an ALSA device when calling
      <code>arecord</code> --- as used to be the case when
      using
      <code>DMIX</code> in the
      <code>pcm.default</code>
      device.</p>
      
      <p>Possible Caveats:
      I am having trouble getting <code>speakfreely</code> to
      work
      reliably --- I've used  it with ALSA in the past --- though
      I'm
      not sure if the <code>ASYM</code> plugin is the
      culprit.</p>

      <p> 
      Advanced Linux Sound Architecture 
      <a href="http://www.alsa-project.org/">
      ALSA</a> is a boon for software TTS users --- you can now use
      your soundcard to produce spoken output while not losing 
      audio output from other applications such as music players and
      streaming radio stations.</p>
      <p>Emacspeak implements an ALSA-enabled TTS server for the IBM
      ViaVoice engine --- 
      using this server effectively requires appropriately tuning the
      parameters in the user's <code>asoundrc</code> file
      to:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Enable the <code>DMix</code> plugin to enable
      software mixing
      of multiple channels of audio.</li>
      <li>To configure the various parameters ALSA itself
      uses.</li></ul>
      
      <p>Depending on how well your sound-card is supported by ALSA,
      the above can be either trivially simple or a  tedious process of
      trial and error. I'm writing this up to:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Collect a  list of sound cards on which the
      <code>asoundrc</code> provided with Emacspeak works as
      expected.</li>
      <li>In the hope that the wider ALSA community discovers and
      helps
      flesh out this material;
      my hope is that 
      the ALSA community has more insight into how thesee settings
      work.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For the above, <em>works effectively</em> means
      the
      following:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The TTS engine speaks without perceptible stuttering or
      other
      audio artifacts.</li>
      <li>The engine is responsive with respect to starting and
      stopping speech; especially when typing fast at high speech
      rates.</li>
      <li>The TTS engine does not interfere with other alsa-enabled
      applications, e.g. <code>mplayer</code>.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>At the end of this entry, you can find the relevant section
      from the    <code>asoundrc</code> file from the
      Emacspeak      distribution, with comments indicating which sound
      cards perform
      well.
      An example of a card that <em>does not</em> work well
      with
      thesee
      settings is the Audigy-LS from Creative; the TTS engine works on
      that card, but performs degrades:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>mplayer cannot use the audio device; (aplay and mpg321 are
      able to share the card with the TTS engine.)</li>
      <li>Speech does not stop immediately as on the soundcards
      enumerated in the <code>asoundrc</code> file.</li>

      <p>
      The similarities between Web access issues faced 
      by mobile users and those confronting eyes-free Web browsing are
      striking, and thesee similarities have often been used to advocate
      the creation of well-structured, accessible  Web content. As an
      example of mobile-friendly content 
      being a blessing for eyes-free spoken access to WebFormation,
      Emacspeak provides a 
      <em>mobile lens</em> via the
      <a href="http://www.google.com/gwt/n">
      Google Mobile</a> transcoder.</p>
      <p>
      Here are a few convenient means of using the above within the
      Emacspeak Audio Desktop:</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li>While browsing the Web using <code>w3</code>,
      press <code>t</code> on a link (command:
      <code>emacspeak-w3-transcode-via-google</code>)
      to view that link through the mobile transcoder.</li>
      <li>Note that all links in the resulting mobile view
      automatically go through the transcoder.</li>
      <li>To  undo the effect of automatically viewing links in the
      mobile view through the transcoder, use <code>t</code>
      with a
      <em>interactive prefix argument</em>
      i.e., press <code>C-u t</code> to follow a link to view
      it in
      its
      original form.</li>
      <li>Additionally, I bind command
      <code>emacspeak-wizards-google-transcode</code>
      to a convenient key so that I can launch Web sites using the
      mobile view.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>I use this tool on a regular basis while commuting to work 
      to
      browse mainstream news sites, it provides speech-friendly content
      that has the added benefit of downloading fast over a wireless
      link --- after all, <strong>this is
      <em>Mobile</em>      content</strong>.

      <p>
      Here is a minor patch to w3.el to allow it to handle content-type
      <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>.
      For all practical  purposes (at least as far as W3 is concerned),
      this can be handled by the html parser/renderer; however since that
      content-type did not exist at the time W3 was written, it offers
      to download/save  documents of that type.
      The attached patch fixes this, and also adds a fix to a minor
      irritant with decoding of multimedia attachments.</p>

    <h2><a name="idm2427" id="idm2427">
      Emacspeak: Connecting Lynx And W3 
    </a></h2>
<div>
<br><div
      xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>Emacs/W3 is still the best Web page rendering option inside
      Emacspeak given the ability to apply XSL transforms, as well as
      obtaining aural styling via ACSS.
      However W3's url handling layer often breaks when faced with
      multiple redirects, especially when some of thesee happen through
      the <code>Host:</code> HTTP header. Additionally,
      <code>HTTPS</code> authentication sometimes fails
      mysteriously in
      the presence of redirects.</p>
      
      <p>In many of thesee cases, <code>lynx</code>
      happily
      fetches the
      pages correctly; however you're then stuck using  a  fairly weak
      auditory interface in that Emacspeak degrades to being
      aterminal level screenreader.</p>
      
      <p>An effective solution to this problem is to use
      <code>lynx</code> within an Emacs terminal, and after
      finding
      the
      content that is worth reading, handing off that content to
      Emacs/W3. The next few paragraphs show how.</p>
      
      <H4>The <code>lynx-site.cfg</code> File</H4>
      
      <p>This is where you add site-specific configurations.
      Here are the lines I have in my <code>lynx-site.cfg
      </code>
      tointegrate <code>lynx</code> and Emacs.
      Before you use any of this, make sure you have executed
      <code>M-x
      server-start</code> in your running Emacs, and make sure that
      all
      is well by experimenting with <code>emacsclient</code>
      to      ensure
      that external programs can hand-off editing tasks to the
      currently running Emacs.</p>
      
      
      <pre>
      #site defaults
      #for bookshare:
      DOWNLOADER:BKS Unpack:bks.pl  %s %s:TRUE 
      PRINTER:Edit:emacsclient %s:TRUE
      KEYMAP:???:EDITTEXTAREA	# use external editor to edit a form
      textarea      PRETTYSRC:TRUE
      SOURCE_CACHE:MEMORY
      SAVE_SPACE:~/.wget/
      BOLD_HEADERS:TRUE
      PRINTER:W3:emacsclient -e '(w3-open-local
      "%s")':TRUE
      </pre>
      <p>Below, I'll describe what each of the above lines
      do:</p>
      
      <ul>
      
      <li> <code>DOWNLOADER:BKS Unpack:bks.pl  %s %s:TRUE
      </code><br/>
      The above line creates an additional item in the <em>download
      menu</em> that invokes the BookShare unpacker.
      Script <code>bks-unpack.pl</code> invokes the BookShare
      unpacktool with the appropriate options.</li>
      <li><code>PRINTER:Edit:emacsclient
      %s:TRUE</code><br/>
      This creates an <em>Edit</em> item in the
      <em>print      menu</em>.
      Invoking this menu item causes the current page to be handed off
      to Emacs for editing.
      If you want to edit the source, first switch to <em>source
      view</em> by hitting <code>\</code> before
      invoking      print.</li>
      <li><code>KEYMAP:???:EDITTEXTAREA	# use external editor
      to
      edit a form textarea</code><br/>
      This sets lynx up so that when editing a multiline textarea, you
      can hand off the editing job to Emacs. This is particularly
      useful for editing Wiki pages. Replace the
      <code>??</code>
      with
      the desired key sequence.</li>
      <li><code>PRETTYSRC:TRUE<br/>
      SOURCE_CACHE:MEMORY</code><br/>
      The above two settings make the edit source functionality more
      pleasant to use.</li>
      <li> <code>PRINTER:W3:emacsclient -e '(w3-open-local
      "%s")':TRUE</code><br/>
      The above creates a <em>W3</em> menu item in the
      <em>print
      menu</em>. Invoking this  causes Emacs/W3 to display the
      current
      page --- again switch to <code>source view</code> before
      invoking
      this so that Emacs/W3 gets handed the HTML markup.</li>
      </ul>

      The feature is probably generally useful  i.e., it's not

      Emacspeak And Voice Locking Using Aural CSS 
    </a></h2>
<div>
<br><div
      xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      
      <p>This is slightly reformatted from what was posted to the
      Emacspeak mailing list as separate message.</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Emacspeak defines a number of voice overlays such as
      <code>voice-bolden</code>, and
      <code>voice-lighten</code> that can be applied to a
      given voice to change what it sounds like.</li>
      
      <li>Voice overlays are defined in terms of Aural CSS (<a
      
      href="http://www.w3.org/tr/css2/aural.html">ACSS</a>)
      to
      keep them independent of a specific TTS engine.</li>
      
      <li>For each such overlay there is a corresponding
      <code>&lt;overlay-name&gt;-settings</code>
      variable
      that can be customized via
      custom.</li>
      
      <li>The numbers in <code>voice-bolden-settings as an

      <table border="2" cellpadding="5">
      <thead>
      <tr>
      <th>Setting</th>
      <th>Value</th>
      </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>

      Unset values (<code>nil</code>) show up as
      "unspecified" in the customize
      interface.
      
      <ol>
      <li>Do not directly customize
      <code>voice-bolden</code>
      and friends, instead
      customize the corresponding
      <code>voice-bolden-settings</code>, since that
      ensures that all voices that are defined in terms of
      <code>voice-bolden</code> get correctly
      updated.</li>
      
      <li>Discovering what to customize:</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>Command
      <code>emacspeak-show-personality-at-point</code> (bound
      by
      default
      to C-e M-v) will show you the value of properties personality and
      face at point. A recent update I implemented last weekend makes
      this more useful, so make sure you do a CVS update; earlier this
      command used to display the ACSS setting --- now it displays the
      abstract name. Describe-variable on thesee names should tell you
      what to customize; so as an example:</p>
      
      <p>Put point on a comment line, and hit <code>C-e
      M-v</code>:
      you will hear</p>
      
      <pre class="example">
      Personality emacspeak-voice-lock-comment-personality
      Face font-lock-comment-delimiter-face
      </pre>
      
      <p>Describe-variable of
      <code>emacspeak-voice-lock-comment-personality</code>
      gives:</p>
      
      <pre class="example">
      emacspeak-voice-lock-comment-personality's value is
      acss-p0-s0-all
      
      Documentation:
      Personality used for font-lock-comment-face
      This personality uses  voice-monotone whose  effect can be changed
      globally by customizing voice-monotone-settings.
      
      </pre>
      
      
      <h3>How It All Works</h3>
      
      <p class="first">Here is a brief explanation of the
      connection between
      <code>voice-bolden</code> and its associated
      <code>voice-bolden-settings</code>.</p>
      
      
      <ol>
      <li>Voice  settings are initially in
      <code>voice-bolden-settings</code> which is a list
      of numbers.</li>
      
      <li>That list of numbers needs to be translated to appropriate
      device-specific codes to send to the TTS engine.</li>
      
      <li>You do not want to do this translation
      <em>each</em> time you
      speak something.</li>
      
      <li>So when <code>voice-bolden</code> is defined,
      the
      definition happens in
      two steps:</li>
      </ol>
      
      <ul>
      <li>The list of settings is stored away in
      <code>voice-bolden-settings</code>,</li>
      <li>A corresponding voice-name is generated ---
      
      
      <code>acss-a&lt;n&gt;-p&lt;n&gt;-r&lt;n&gt;-s&lt;n&gt;</code> and the corresponding control codes to
      send to the device are stored away in a hash-table keyed by the
      above      symbol.</li>
      
      <li>Finally, <code>voice-bolden</code> is assigned
      the
      above symbol.</li>
      </ul>
      
      
      <h3>What this gives is:</h3>
      
      <ol>
      <li>The ability to customize the voice via custom by editing
      the list of numbers in
      <code>voice-bolden-settings</code></li>
      
      <li>When that list is edited,
      <code>voice-bolden</code> is arranged to be
      updated automatically.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Other Useful Commands</h3>
      <p>In addition, commands
      <code>emacspeak-wizards-generate-voice-sampler</code>
      can be
      useful in generating a buffer that shows what the various ACSS
      settings sound like.
      Command <code>emacspeak-wizards-voice-sampler</code> can
      be
      used
      to apply a specific voice to a region of text while experimenting
      with the various settings.</p>

      SuDoKu Using Auditory Feedback 
    </a></h2>
<div>
<br><div
      xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>Emacspeak speech-enables <em>SuDoKu</em>
      implemented
      by <a
      
      
      href="http://www.columbia.edu/~jr2075/elisp/index.html">sudoku.el</a>.
      Speech-enabling games is an effective means of discovering what
      additions one needs to make to an auditory interface for
      working effectively in an eyes-free environment --- this was
      aptly demonstrated a few years ago by identifying interesting
      <em>conversational gestures</em> by speech-enabling the
      game
      of
      <code>Tetris</code> --- see  <a
      
      
      href="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/raman/publications/assets-98/paper.pdf">Conversational
      Gestures For The Audio Desktop</a> from Assets 1998.</p>
      
      
      <h4>Advising Interactive Commands</h4>
      <p>As with speech-enabling any Emacs module,
      <code>emacspeak-sudoku</code>
      <em>advices</em>
      all interactive
      commands to produce spoken feedback.
      In addition to speaking the cell moved to, all navigation
      commands produce an auditory icon that is a function of whether
      the cell value is mutable ---  original values cannot be changed
      and this is indicated with a distinctive icon.</p>
      
      <h4>Additional Interactive Commands</h4>
      
      <p>Playing SuDoKu effectively requires one to build a good
      mental
      image of the state of the board as well as the ability to
      effectively query the game for currently active constraints. The
      eye's ability to  quickly move around the board and perceive
      row,      column and sub-square constraints needs to be compensated
      for in
      an eyes-free environment. As an example, it is too difficult to
      build the necessary mental model by just listening to the board
      spoken aloud, or by listening to idnividual cells by navigating
      to them.</p>
      
      <p>Here are the set of additional interactive commands that
      needed to be added in order to be able to play the game
      effectively.</p>
      
      <dl>
      <dt><code>r</code></dt>
      <dd>Speak current row.</dd>
      <dt><code>c</code></dt>
      <dd>Speak current column</dd>
      <dt><code>s</code></dt>
      <dd>Speak current sub-square.</dd>
      <dt><code>R</code></dt>
      <dd>Speak number of remaining cells in current row.</dd>
      <dt><code>C</code></dt>
      <dd>Speak number of remaining cells in current
      column.</dd>
      <dt><code>S</code></dt>
      <dd>Speak number of remaining cells in current
      sub-square.</dd>
      <dt><code>d</code></dt>
      <dd>Move to the sub-square below the current
      sub-square.</dd>

      <dd>Move to the beginning of current row.</dd>
      <dt><code>e</code></dt>
      <dd>Move to the end of the current row.</dd>
      <dt><code>t</code></dt>
      <dd>Move to the top of the current column.</dd>
      <dt><code>b</code></dt>
      <dd>Move to the bottom of the current column.</dd>
      <dt><code>,</code></dt>
      <dd>Speaks information about the overall
      <em>distribution</em> of
      numbers on the board.
      <ul>
      <li><code>d</code> --- Conveys how many instances
      of
      each digit
      have been filled in.</li>
      <li><code>s</code> --- Conveys number of remaining
      cells in each
      sub-square.</li>
      <li><code>r</code> --- Conveys number of remaining
      cells in each
      row.</li>
      <li><code>c</code> --- Conveys number of remaining
      cells in each
      column.</li>
      </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt><code>/</code></dt>
      <dd>Speaks number of remaining cells in the current
      board.</dd>
      <dt><code>.</code></dt>
      <dd>Speaks value in current cell.</dd>
      </dl>
      
      <p>Notes on how invormation is spoken:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Numbers are spoken in groups of 3 to achieve effective
      intonation.</li>
      <li>When navigating by sub-squares, point
      <em>always</em> moves
      to the top left corner of the sub-square.</li>
      <li>Additional commands bound to <code>M-r</code>,
      <code>M-c</code> and <code>M-s</code> erase
      the
      current row,
      column or sub-square respectively. These commands would probably
      be convenient to have independent of whether one is using visual
      output.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Effectiveness Of The Resulting Interface</h4>
      
      <p>With the above interface in place, the simpler levels of
      the      game are a breeze, levels <em>difficult</em>
      and      <em>evil</em>
      are sufficiently challenging to be fun.</p>

      <p>Sourceforge is a nice service, but it can also be painful
      to      use because of the heavy-weight Web page design, and the
      need to
      repeatedly click before you get the download you want.</p>
      <p>The most irksome of thesee is the download mechanism
      provided      by Sourceforge --- where you first need to browse a
      list of
      download servers, pick a mirror, and then download what you
      want. 
      Emacspeak implements a <em>Smart URL</em> that enables
      one to
      download from Sourceforge in a single step.</p>
      <p>By default, this uses a North American mirror; the behavior
      can be customized if outside the US.
      Use <em>smart URL</em> <code>Sourceforge Browse
      Mirror</code> and
      specify the name of a SF hosted project when prompted.
      This brings up the index page for the project's download area,
      sorted by date. Move to the bottom of the page and   hit
      <code>b</code> to move to the latest available
      download.</p>
      <p>The <em>smart URL</em> sets up the W3 buffer
      with a
      context-sensitive download function; when on a download link, hit
      <code>C-d</code>
      to start downloading. This command will prompt for the URL;
      rather than hitting <code>return</code> (which would
      bring
      you to
      the <em>browse mirrors</em> page, hit
      <code>M-p</code> to get the
      download URL for your  SF mirror.
      Note that this wizard uses <code>GNU wget</code> to
      perform
      the
      download
      via Emacs module <code>w3-wget</code>.</p>

    <h2><a name="idm2497" id="idm2497">BBC
      Channels On Emacspeak 
    </a></h2>
<div>
<br><div
      xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>Since the BBC's various channels are what I listen to
      the
      most, launching BBC channels has always been a couple of
      keystrokes in Emacspeak. As a first step, directory
      <code>realaudio/radio</code> contains shortcut files for
      launching  live streams from the various BBC channels.</p>
      <p>
      In addition, module <code>emacspeak-url-template</code>
      defines a
      number of <em>Smart URLs</em> for single-click access to
      BBC
      programs. The ones I use the most are:</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li><em>Smart URL</em> <code>BBC Channels On
      Demand</code>, and </li>
      <li><em>Smart URL</em> <code>BBC Genres On
      Demand</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      These <em>smart URLs</em> prompt for the channel or
      genre      respectively and bring up a Web page that lists the
      various shows
      that are available --- note that the BBC archives shows for a
      whole week.
      The resulting Web page is easy to browse in W3; the most
      effective way to skim the buffer is to repeatedly hit
      <code>i</code> which moves through the various items on
      the
      page.
      Hitting <code>e e</code> (that's the letter
      <code>e</code>
      <em>twice</em>) while on a hyperlink will launch the
      corresponding media stream by calling   a
      <em>context-aware</em>
      command that knows about transforming the URL to one that
      accesses the program stream; --- note that simply following the
      hyperlink will get you first to a page about the program, rather
      than to the program stream itself.</p>
      <p>To find out what channels and genres are available, browse
      the
      BBC Web site --- channel and genre names are not hard-wired into
      Emacspeak since thesee can change over time with channels and
      genres being added or renamed.</p>

      <p>Emacspeak implements a number of <code>smart

      Command Line</a>. Many of thesee <code>smart
      URLs</code>
      prompt
      the user for the date, e.g. you can use <code>smart
      URL</code><em>NPR On Demand</em> to play  archived
      NPR
      shows.
      </p>
      <p>The most intuitive means of specifying a date is of course
      using a <code>calendar</code> that functions as a
      <em>date-picker</em>, and Emacs has a very powerful
      built-in
      calendar. Emacspeak ties thesee two together by arranging for
      commands that prompt for a date to use the <em>current
      date</em>
      in the  Emacs Calendar as the default. So the easiest way to play
      <em>NPR Morning Edition</em> for  <em>Monday,
      January
      2, 2006</em>
      is to do the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>Switch to the Emacs Calendar and move to the desired date
      <em>Monday January 2, 2006</em> by pressing

      <p>The most effective way of viewing Atom Feeds in Emacspeak
      is      to use command
      <code>emacspeak-atom-display</code> and
      specifying
      the URL of the feed when prompted. Thus, <code>M-x
      emacspeak-atom-display RET
      http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/atom.xml</code> displays a Web
      page
      generated from the Emacspeak Blog.</p>
      <p>Notice the following in the generated Web page:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>It starts with a navigable table of contents.</li>
      <li>Each Blog entry has a  link labeled
      <code>edit</code> next to
      it.</li>
      <li>Each Blog entry ends with a link labeled
      <code>Bookmark</code>.</li>
      <li>There is a link labeled <code>Post</code> at
      the
      top of the
      page.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The above links help you easily create and edit posts to
      the      Blog if you have write access using commands provided by
      module
      <code>atom-blogger</code>.
      Eventually, I may add commands to thesee hyperlinks to
      automatically invoke the appropriate command from
      <code>atom-blogger</code>; for now, I find it 
      sufficiently
      convenient to copy the URL under point to the
      <code>kill-ring</code> and later yank it back into the

      <div>
      <p>While reading online texts on programming in Python and
      Ruby,
      I noticed that Emacspeak was not announcing indented lines in
      preformatted source-code examples, even with <code>audio
      indentation</code> turned on.
      The reason is that many of thesee texts use an HTML non-breaking
      space for indentation, and though W3 was rendering thesee
      correctly, the default syntax table in W3 had not defined the
      resulting <code>octal 240</code> to be of class
      white-space. Consequently, Emacspeak's audio indentation code
      was      not treating the non-breaking space as white
      space.</p>
      <p>I've checked in a patch to
      <code>emacspeak-w3.el</code> that
      modifies the syntax table in <code>w3-mode</code>
      by adding the appropriate lines to
      <code>w3-mode-hook</code>.

      <code>help-key</code> (<code>C-h</code>)
      results
      in Emacs
      displaying a <strong>*Help*</strong> buffer that lists
      all
      key-sequences beginning with that prefix. </p>
      
      <p>This can be a very useful way of quickly seeing what
      keyboard
      commands are available ---  as  the resulting listing is 
      shorter than what is produced by <code>C-h b</code>
      (command
      describe-bindings) which lists all key-bindings.
      </p>
      <p>To  use this feature to review Emacspeak's
      key-bindings, I have now moved command
      <code>emacspeak-learn-emacs-mode</code> to
      <code>C-h
      C-l</code>
      and <code>C-e F1</code>
      from its original key-binding of <code>C-e C-h</code> 
      ---
      thechange is checked into CVS.</p>

    <h2><a name="idm2623" id="idm2623">Using
      The New MPlayer With ALSA Support 

    </a></h2>
<div>
<br><div
      xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>
      New versions of the Linux <code>mplayer</code>
      can now play RealMedia files in addition to the various DVD and
      Windows
      audio and video streams.
      As an added bonus, <code>mplayer</code> can be built to
      use
      ALSA ---(note that default RPMs available on the Web still default
      to OSS
      as of December 2006).
      This, with the additional support for  newer RealMedia formats has
      finally caused me to switch away from
      <code>trplayer</code>
      a---a command line RealPlayer that was built against RealPlayer
      8.0</p>
      <p>Note that building <code>mplayer</code> from
      source
      to include ALSA support, and locating all the  codecs you need will
      require a few Google searches. Specifically, to play NPR streams,
      you      will need to grab <code>avisynth.dll</code>
      from the
      SourceForge project of the same name. But once this is done,
      <code>mplayer</code> will happily play multiple streams
      of
      audio without requiring multichannel support from the sound card.
      For      Emacspeak users this means that you get auditory icons, and
      more
      importantly software TTS while listening to audio streams.</p>
      <p>
      To use software TTS while <code>mplayer</code> is
      playing      audio streams requires that you use a TTS server that
      uses ALSA; the
      default Emacspeak servers still use OSS.
      To build a TTS server for IBM ViaVoice TTS, obtain Emacspeak sources
      from
      CVS, and follow the instructions in file
      <code>servers/linux-outloud/ALSA</code>.
      </p>
      <p>As of a few weeks ago, The Emacspeak CVS repository has
      been      updated so that all access to streaming media goes through
      <code>mplayer</code> by default.  Make sure to configure
      your
      <code>mplayer</code> with a smaller cache size if you
      use it
      exclusively for streaming audio; by default it uses a rather
      large cache, and streaming realaudio often takes a long time to
      start before the cache is configured to be something smaller; I
      use a cache size of <code>64kb</code> on my
      laptop.</p>

      I'm posting this using a bare-boned
      <code>atom-blogger</code> that I implemented this
      morning.
      It uses <code>curl</code> to  process the HTTP Post
      Request.</p>
      <h3>Editing Previous Entries</h3>
      <p>What's more, the bare-bones atom-blogger can now edit
      previous posts.
      This is done by getting the desired entry, filtering it for elements
      that
      should not be present when submitting updates, and adding a
      <code>generator</code> element --- all of thesee steps
      are      required by the Blogger API.
      Unwanted elements are filtered out using
      <code>xsltproc</code>.
