* Summary

A collection of keybinding changes I have arrived at over time to
protect my fingers.Note that I have now used Emacs for more than 33
years, and some of these changes may well have helped me much earlier;
on the other hand, I likely didn't notice these issues because my
hands then were not the same as what they are now.

See earlier articles on this topic for context:

  -  [[https://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2023/02/enhance-emacs-ergonomics-under-x-happy.html][Minimize chording using XCape]]
  -  [[https://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2023/07/ergonomic-buffer-selection-on-emacs.html][Ergonomic Buffer Selection]]

So to summarize,  my Emacs uses:

  1. *CapsLock* as /Control/.
  2. Using XCape, quickly releasing /Control/ emits /C-e/ --- the
     eEmacspeak prefix-key.

* Next, Some Finger Tips

Note: I'm not a trained ergonomist; the following are observations
based on my experience and may not apply to everyone; I suspect the
size of one's hands, the width of the keyboard etc., all matter. For
the last 3+ years, I've exclusively used a laptop keyboard, in my case
a Lenovo.

  1. I now find that replacing key-chords by a sequence of non-chords
     makes my hands happier. The trick is to replace a chord by no
     more than 2 keys.
  2. Since Caps lock (left pinky) is my /Control/ key, /C-s/ is  not
     as nice as /C-l/; notice that the former requires chording with
     two fingres of the same hand, whereas the lattre spreads the work
     among both hands on an English _qwerty_ keyboard.
  3. One work-around for the above might be to have _RET_ emit
     /Control/ if held down,  but I haven't done that (yet).
  4. On the left-hand, chords that require extending or scrunching
     one's fingres when hitting a chord are more painful. Thus, /C-z/
     and /C-x/ are more painful to hit than /C-d/. Emacs hardly uses
     /C-z/; but unfortunately, /C-x/ is an important prefix key in
     stock Emacs.

* Now For The Finger Tips 


  1. I have /left-shift/ and /right-shift/ emit /C-s/ and /C-r/
   using XCape.
  2. I bound /C-l/ to _ctl-x-map_ (still experimental). This remapping
     fails to take effect in places like /Dired/ and /Gnus/.
  3. I additionallly bound /find-file/ to /C-; o/.
  4. A long time ago, I discovered /M-m/ (back-to-indentation) and I
     never hit /C-a/ to move to the start of the line.
  5. When I remap things, I *never* take away the original Emacs
     bindings; I only provide alternatives.
  6. I use /C-,/, /C-./, /C-;/, and /C-'/ as prefix keys. Downside:
     these only work under X, but the time where I only ran Emacs in a
     terminal are long gone.

See my 
[[https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak/blob/master/tvr/emacs-startup.el#L245][Emacs]] Startup File
for the setup.

* Conclusion

There's likely a lot more to be discovered in this context; time will
reveal all!
