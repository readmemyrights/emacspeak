;;; Commentary:

;; speech-enable ido.el This is an interesting task since most of the
;; value-add provided by package ido.el is visual feedback.  Speech UI
;; Challenge: What is the most efficient means of conveying a
;; dynamically updating set of choices?  current strategy is to walk
;; the list using c-s and c-r as provided by ido Set number matches
;; shown (ido-max-prospects) to 2 or 3 using Custom so you dont hear the
;; entire list. You can also customize @var{ido-decorations} to taste.
;; See
;; @url{https://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2018/06/\
;;effective-suggest-and-complete-in-eyes.html},
;; for an article on how to reason about designing  good auditory
;; interfaces for these types of situations.
